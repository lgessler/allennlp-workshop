I am an avid Montreal eater and have worked in the food industry for over 10 years and have never faced such defensive behaviour. I ordered the salad, which on the menu said contained julienned papayas, and when I inquired with the very polite waiter about it, the owner blew up at me from across the kitchen and said \\\"I decided not to put them in.\\\" When I gently replied that they should perhaps warn their customers that the menu has changed, he snapped at me making all sorts of random excuses. I said ok, no problem and continued eating. He shouted, again from across the restaurant that he would remove 1$ off our 47$ bill. Ok. We said ok. After the bill was paid, he continued harassing me, questioning my knowledge of the restaurant industry and attacking me with snarky comments. This is not acceptable. I could not believe it. I will not condone this behaviour from a restaurant and I pity the staff who need to work with this overblown ego of a man. As for the food, the salad was sopping in sauce, she sushi was no better than anywhere else, and the bill was 47$ for two people, for lunch. Go if you like, but I would stand in solidarity against such a vicious place."}

{"label": 3, "text": "I've\\\"ve been somewhat dissatisfied with the old Monta at spring mountain/Decatur due to its inconsistent quality as well as recent health inspection issues, so I was looking forward to seeing how the new place on the other side of town would be like.\\n\\nI heard that it was next to Japan Creek, but as I drove by, I did not see any signs anywhere, but I was surprised to find out that the restaurant was virtually full of customers.  How did they find out?  It was nice to see that the new place is about the twice the size of the old place.\\n\\nThe menu was virtually identical, but with additional \\\"chaya\\\" offerings such as chicken karaage, daikon salad, hakusai salad and such.  \\n\\nI tried chicken karaage, which was very well done, hot, juicy and tasty.  I liked the daikon salad as I love anything daikon, but it reminded me more of daikon sunomono, and was slightly heavy on vinegar taste as I was expecting more of a sweet sesame dressing kind of thing, but I still liked it.  \\n\\nI also had fried rice, but this was mediocre at best.  It was way too oily IMO.  Well done fried rice should be dry and not wet, as a huge firepower from the grill should burn off the oil as you swing the rice into the air as you mix it in a wok.  I think the chef doesn't have the fried rice cooking mastered yet.  As a matter of fact, quite a bit far from it.  \\n\\nI had tonkotsu ramen and it was virtually identical to that of old Monta.  Not too fatty, but cloudy white tonkotsu broth was better done than the old Monta plagued by inconsistencies in recent months.    \\n\\nI like this place.  I just wish they've opened it in Summerlin instead of Henderson."}
{"label": 3, "text": "Summerlin-ers have every right to be jealous, since the newly opened Monta Chaya in Henderson is every bit as good as the flagship Monta, thereby negating the need to make the drive to Spring Mountain.\\n\\nIf  Monta Chaya is the sister restaurant to Monta, I would liken the former to Monta-ca (er...I mean Monica) Cruz, Penelope Cruz's younger and less famous sister, who is every bit as beautiful with perhaps more charm and flare for style (she's a fashion designer and world class flamenco dancer).  This comes in the form of a more spacious interior with higher ceilings, located next door to the adorable  Japan Creek Market (borrowing a page from Fukumimi Ramen which also has an adjacent Japanese market next door), and the additional flight of \\\"chaya\\\" appetizers consisting of the following:\\n*chicken karaage\\n*flash-fried shishito peppers\\n*daikon salad with shredded egg,rice crackers, seaweed, and Wafu dressing\\n*fried calamari in broth \\n*chasu buns (similar to Ippudo in Manhattan)\\n*Hakusai salad (napa cabbage, crispy chili threads, crunchy noodles, sesame dressing)\\n\\nRamen and standard appetizers appears identical to the original location, and I went with the Hiyashi Chuka, which appears primarily during the warm months at Monta, so not sure if they plan on keeping this as a permanent item.\\n\\nThe Hikyashi Chuka is a cold ramen without broth which I liken to a bizarro version of the Korean bibimbap (hear me out)\\nRather than piping hot rice, assortment of julienned veggies, bulgogi, red chili paste, and fried egg mixed together in the Korean dish, you have nice firm cold noodles topped with julienned scrambled egg, cucumbers, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, sprouts, marinated pork belly, sweet pickled radish, tomato, and a dollop of Japanese mustard on the side and your choice of sesame or yuzu dressing.  Deciding to feel a bit more untraditional, I went with yuzu and the dish was a refreshing mixture of textures, colors, and interplay of sweet spicy salty and sour.  Word of caution: unless you want to simulate biological warfare on your sinuses, do not mix the entire portion of japanese mustard into the mix.  Just use the end of your chopstick and do a light schmear into each bite to get that little hit much like you would for wasabi on sushi.      \\n\\nA wonderful addition to the ever-expanding ramen scene in Las Vegas and which will hopefully keep Shoku Ramen nearby on its toes so that the victors in the battle for ramen supremacy in Henderson will ultimately be diners like ourselves."}

Ramen Sora and Fukumimi are my only other ramen joints that I have hit out here in Vegas.  So far, I would still have Sora as my favorite with Monta coming in at a very close second.  Others may think differently, but this is my review and it's my opinion.\\n\\nMy ramen of choice at Monta was the Shoyo Ramen w/two extra eggs.  This is my favorite type of ramen...silky, thick, and the broth was perfect.  The eggs were cut in half, which gave the extra taste and protein. Taste of my ramen is very similar to what you get at Sora. I didn't try anything else because I was trying to save room for dessert.  Come to think of it, I didn't even finish my ramen.  The rest of the group ordered a mixed bag. I'm sure it was good for them too because everything was demolished.  \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small, like Fukumimi.

Not only does this Monta have more roomier and friendlier interior, but the staff are topnotch and very friendly. Because I go around 3-4 pm, Its not as packed as the other Monta, giving the employees more time to relax and help you out, whereas you rarely see the employees at the original Monta because it is so hectic.

The broth has rich deep porky flavor and is not too salty.  The noodles are cooked to the perfect firmness.  The nitamago is, to me, one of the best parts of a ramen dish and as usual, Monta makes them perfectly.

{"label": 1, "text": "Most people who know me well would say that I am OBSESSED with noodle dishes of any kind, and ramen is on my top 3. I can literally enjoy a bowl of ramen (or two) every single day and not get tired of it. However, my experience at Monta Chaya was not as heavenly as I had hoped. \\n\\nI ordered the tonkatsu/shoyu broth and although ramen is traditionally pretty salty and high in sodium content, this was too much for me. The broth was so unbelievably salty that I couldn't even enjoy the noodles in the bowl. I've had tonkatsu ramen and shoyu ramen in ramen-yas in LA, NYC, and Vegas, and I must say... here their broth is a bit too thick and heavy, the saltiest of them all! Basically, I ALWAYS get double the noodles at ramen-yas. This time, I had no desire to order kaedama. \\n\\nI've always spoke highly of the gyoza at the original Monta on Spring Mountain Rd., and I was excited to order some during my visit to the new location; however, the waitress informed me that the new gyoza is deep-fried... :*(, so I chose to live without it. When I saw a plate of gyoza being delivered to another table, I saw that it's definitely nothing like the amazing gyoza served on Spring Mountain. That's a real shame! The gyoza in the original Monta is NUMBER ONE in Vegas, in my book. \\n\\nThe karaage was a HUGE disappointment. The breading was bland and the chicken inside was stringy. The steamed pork buns were \\\"O-K\\\". We've had much better ones in various Chinese restaurants. \\n\\nThe other big negative is that they do not offer one spicy-flavored broth. To me, there are very few things that are more incredible than a large bowl of spicy ramen, especially when the spicy is done right (cough, ramen sora, cough cough.)\\n\\nAll in all, I know Monta and Monta Chaya are huge hits in the Vegas ramen-eating community, and I can respect and understand why; however, it is not my cup of tea. I would go to the new Ramen Tatsu for my tonkatsu broth cravings and Ramen Sora for ... pretty much everything else :)."}

Yes,it's a ramen place,and they serve a few rice topping bowls,but missing some Japanese house staples like chicken cutlet (tonkatsu). \\n\\nAll in all,it's not a bad place for a late night meal (closes at 11pm most nights),which makes it a good late post-gym alternative if you don't want to cook. \\n\\nLong.

The pork was dry, smushed between lettuce, ketchup, and mayo. Needless to say it was gross, so I waited for my ramen but wasn't impressed. The broth was lacking in flavor, and the egg was way over cooked. I will definitely be sticking to my favorite monta spot in china town."}

He was eating part of the salad he was preparing for a customer. This really grossed me out. Shortly after eating here I got a stomach ache.

{"label": 0, "text": "I was craving ramen so we went to  Monta Chaya on Eastern.  The reviews were really good so we just had to try it.  We ordered the tonkatsu ramen and pork belly bowl.  Both dishes were sooooo full of oil and pork fat.  We picked through our ramen, did not drink the broth.   The broth is like a thick gravy with lots of oil.  I don't think it's the good kind of fat either.  It's probably pork fat I'm guessing.  Now for the pork belly bowl.  You can't really see the oil in the pork belly bowl because the rice soaks it up.  Ask the server for a side of the sauce that goes in the pork belly bowl and you will see what I mean.  The pork belly bowl was kind of bland so we asked for a side of sauce.  There is about 1/2\\\" layer of pure melted, saturated fat on top of the sauce.  I'm not a health nut but I try to watch what I eat and this stuff is totally off the charts.  I've been to other ramen houses in Las Vegas and they are no where as greasy as this place.  If you like good ramen, try Sora Ramen on Spring Mountain.  Very authentic Japanese ramen $6.95 and you can get a mini curry bowl (delicious) for $2.65.  Oh, and the service was excellent and the waittress was awesome so that was the only good thing about Monta Chaya.  But I will not be back to this place."}

This location is probably slightly bigger than the old location but still not that big.\\n\\nGetting straight to the point, I really don't like the ramen here.  The broth is consistently thick and oily and quite too often am I downing my water to combat the saltiness of the ramen.  You can ask them to cut down on the salt content but it really doesn't make a difference.  \\n\\nOverall: The broth is really thick and oily making it difficult to get that warm refreshness comparable to having a nice hot bowl of pho.

When I noticed this one pop up on Yelp on our way into Vegas, we just HAD TO re-route our GPS to grab lunch here first.  As luck would have it, we arrived about 5 minutes before opening where there were already 3 or 4 parties waiting for the sign the flip.\\n\\nI enjoyed this location so much more because it was bigger, less cramped and you weren't made to feel like you need to slurp down your (yummy) noodles and get the hell out.  \\n\\nThe noodles are just as tasty...the thick sticky broth made me hear angels sing.  My only complaint is that they don't give you very much broth...but I guess we're really just here for the noodles.  As the broth cools, it gets thicker and does a really good job of hanging onto the noodles.  In this respect, I think it's different than the broth at other places.\\n\\nWe also ordered the daikon salad.  This dish elevated the lowly turnip into a crisp, refreshing masterpiece, garnished with these crispy little rice ball bits.\\n\\nKaraage (fried chicken nuggets) was also very tasty.  I ate mine with a lot of crushed garlic.  Hubby really appreciated me doing so.\\n\\nFinally, we also ordered my 2nd favorite thing - the takana fried rice.  At this point, I could only manage a few bites but it still hit my lofty expectations.  A few hours later, I enjoyed the leftovers as a wonderful cold snack.  Yum.\\n\\nAs mentioned, service wasn't frenetic and indifferent like the other branch.  These people were allowed the luxury of being friendly and nice at a leisurely pace.

We liked the bun at Jinya because they give a much thicker and juicier piece of pork belly. The gyoza was also just ok. Definitely need sauce as it lacks in flavor.

The pork belly bowl was pretty yummy.  It is over rice and is so flavorful that it made my tastebuds happy.  The shoyu ramen was your basic bowl of ramen.  It's decent, no complaints here.  I wasn't too fond of the chashu buns tho.  After having chashu buns from Bachi Burger, a burger joint nearby, nothing compares...now that's what I call yummy goodness!!!

One bowl of ramen also really wasn't very filling. But considering it's Vegas and there really aren't many options, it's not bad. If you're craving ramen and stuck in Vegas, then Monta Chaya is not a bad option.

I get that there is a lot of beers on tap and the taps change, which is cool, but when I ask about a unique beer or a specific type on draft, I expect an answer besides \\\"I don't know\\\".  I wanted to love this spot for its dive bar feel, selection of draft beer, and food served till 2 AM, but the service and management make it really hard to like.  specifically Michelle, goes out of her way to avoid you, if she doesn't like you, which would be fine if she didn't tell her coworkers and other customers how much she hates you, which all of them will gladly remind you of.  Her unprofessionalism of bringing up past (4 or 5 years ago) issues dampers the atmosphere and adds and high school drama feel to the whole place.  And don't bother talking to management, regardless of her unprofessionalism, poor judgment, poor service, and flat out rudeness the owner will take her side, even though he is losing major money in his pocket!  regardless of a \\\"past history\\\" with Michelle or not, I can guarantee that you will have poor service, overpriced beers, and an uncomfortable atmosphere.

Great beer selection and highly knowledgable staff. I wasn't sure which beer to try the server and bartender helped me find a few new beers that I've never had. Solid IPA selection which was perfect for my friend. This is definitely a place I will come back to either for a night out drinking or lunch with my folks. Super comfortable and great food. Lo mien hit the spot and the jalape\\u00f1o puffs were awesome! \\nSuper fun and friendly environment, good looking staff (big plus), awesome food, and holy crap food available until 2AM!!!!!!!!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Man, the amazing hand made Veggie Egg Rolls stuffed with cabbage, sprouts, and ginger in a nice thick wonton wrapper at the old Chop and Wok location have been replaced with frozen egg rolls out of a bag stuffed with mush.  I am so sad.  The old egg rolls were one of my favorite food items in the Valley.  I used to pick up bag fulls to take home and savor.  Today I bought 4 of them, but called it a day after eating one.  If you ever bring the old ones back Cop and Wok, I would be eternally grateful!\\n\\n*This review is only for the veggie egg roles and not intended to reflect anything else the Chop and Wok offers.  The service today was also really good fwiw."}
{"label": 0, "text": "By far the worst costumer service evercompletely blown away how rude they were! What happened to the costumer always being right no matter what the circumstances may be. Gave me chicken instead of shrimp call back talk to a bimbo named Amanda that said that it'd only by 30 minutes to deliver which she offered since that'd be the tight thing to do since the order was messed up. Over an hour later nothing came and called back everyone played dumb asking round saying no one heard of such thing happening. Even though called out Amanda, the girl that I talked to that assured me of this deal then  tried saying would be delivery charge when it wasn't my fault in the first place so why would i be paying for when they messed up. told them they needed to get their \\\"stuff\\\" together for messing up and now I'm the one being innoprioate. Hope they'll miss the weekend business they get from my huge family cause we will never being eating their shitty over priced crappy food again mostly because this isn't the first time they've messed up like this forgetting things here or there.  They didn't even try to resolve it or do something to try make something work for the costumer cause who knew business revolves with making the customer happy.  If I could I would give 0 stars when rating this pathetic establishment that shouldn't have tried to make a come back."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I have been eating here since the late 90's when I was in college. I watched them grow from one small room to two. I was so excited to try their new location. I came in after work alone on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I was excited to see the great beer selection. I ordered a vanilla porter. It was quite tasty. It took awhile to put a food order in but the food came out pretty fast. I had the orange chicken and a teriyaki egg roll. Both where very good. My beer was gone by this point and I was never offered water. I sat and sat and sat and sat with zero service. My bartender a female with sunglasses on her head ignored me and the only other guy sitting on the one side of the bar. A bartender asked him eventually what he wanted but\\nDidnt acknowledge me. Finally the female bartender asked if I wanted another beer I said no just a to go container and my tab. I am seriously disappointed. So my one piece of advice is call in a to go and pick it up yourself. Don't waster your time with the terrible customer service!!  Ug. Terrible!!"}

{"label": 1, "text": "I always liked this place when they were at Scottsdale and Shea, now they are around the corner on Scottsdale Road. The interior is funky dive decor. Went for lunch. Had a fantastic gal as a server, very on top of things, even bringing sodas in a to go cup without asking. The sweet and sour pork would have been good but the pork was so tough, like shoe leather, I could barely chew it. Brown rice was excellent, egg roll was marginal and the won ton was cold and tough. Portions are huge. I will give it another try to see if other dishes are better. If they use a better cut of pork this might make all the difference. Large bar area with tvs."}

My friend had pepper beef which also not good and she said it was very old tasting.  perhaps others can see some positives here in new location... but food is not worth trying it."}

What I found was a super cool bar with crazy decorations and colors and pretty damn good food too, at very reasonable prices. I was told their chicken fried steak is a must try, so I'll have to get that next time. The bartender and cook were very friendly. Also came back one night for drinks with a girlfriend and once again had a very cool bartender, and we opted for some asian dishes which weren't bad at all. Really cool place for drinks with friends, will come back for sure. \\n\\nTip- this place opens up like at 7am on weekends!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "I really wanted to love this place especially because I like supporting neighborhood restaurants instead of the big chains.  However, the food is just marginal.  The egg roll was so small, lacked flavor and was very mushy - perhaps it was a frozen variety?  The cashew chicken had very little chicken and cashews and way too many mushrooms.  The mongolian beef was okay, but not the best I've ever had.  Ordered the crispy honey chicken for the kiddos and it should have been called the mushy chicken.  I think if they would infuse some more flavor to their menu then this could be a great place."}

Not one of the take out boxeswerer labeled, so it was a mystery as to what you were eating.  Meat?  Where was the meat?  If there was a piece or two the beef was tough and grisly, chicken obsolete.  There was so much sauce I questioned if it was stew!!  Ordered the Kung Pao chicken and if I got it, which I don't know it all looked and tasted the same, there was no spice at all.   Crab puffs were the only saving grace and a reminder that I really did order from Chop and Wok. \\n\\nNever again will I order from Chop and Wok.  I have been a customer since I was in highschool  and am so disappointed that this legend has gone bust with crappy food! \\n\\nHope the owners really take a good look at these reviews as many of us are saying the exact same thing."}

My broccoli order was wrong and I was brought chicken and oyster sauce. But the waitress apologiesed and got me the right order. The shrimp looked good and my boyfriend said it tasted like an average Chinese dish. However not long after he found himself kneeled over the toilet for hours.

So, you ask the bartender and he will say \\\"I will find someone to help you\\\"\\nDo you go for ambience? No, it's let's say \\\"eclectic\\\" and if you look around the place is dirty.\\nSo why go? Well, it was a group of 6 of us and we had a good time. You know what to expect there, not much.

When we came in it smelled as if some one had taken disgusting mop water and thrown it around like holy water to christen the whole place. YUK. But, we were hungry and wanted to give this place a try since it is right next to our favorite pizza joint, Oregano's. \\nWe ordered the BBQ Lo Mein, Orange Beef, and Orange Chicken, and Crab Wantons. All of it was gross. The orange sauce had no flavor at all but when combined with the chicken and beef it made it have a bitter harsh after taste. The Lo Mein was slimy, mushy, and tasted like beef ramen  packets had been thrown in. The wantons were underfilled, dripping in grease, and tasteless. \\nOur server was tolerable, she obviously was more interested in socializing with her obnoxious co workers than making sure our teas were full or we were ok. We were each going to order a beer or two, but never got the chance. She kept asking if we were ready for our check, even before we were half done with our meal. We had to wait till after 1 AM for our direct deposit to hit our account before we could leave, and trust me, it was not a moment too soon.I had already been sick to my stomach once since eating there in the two hours. If I had thought about it I would have asked for a refund. We definitely will not be returning!"}

Smokers on the patio with a door left open means the whole place reeked of smoke.  Yahoooweee! \\n\\nKeeping an open mind, we placed a food order.  Service was pleasant but painfully slow.  Food arrived with no serving utensils (really???), we didn't bother to go hunt someone down for these missing items.   Happily we actually did have a fork AND knife (try getting a knife in a real Chinese restaurant).  Food was okay but nothing remarkable.  \\n\\nWe were told they had live music scheduled for 8pm but we didn't stick around long enough to find out who or what that meant.  Oddly enough, for a place that is \\\"newly relocated\\\" it looked like it had been there for a really long time, ie., peeling paint on the walls, worn out barstools, doesn't look very clean....

Seemed to be of the frozen variety and deep fried not steamed or pan fried like every other dumpling. They were boring tasting and I wasn't a fan of the outside or inside texture. Now the lo mien insanely boring no flavor one bite and I was done. Now the chicken lettuce wraps totally inedible. By far one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth. Just gross tasting, can't really describe it but I took one bite and then dropped that bite back on to my plate. On the plus side the delivery was reasonably fast, items were well packaged and arrived hot, and came with appropriate utensils and condiments. Overall big waste of my money and I'm def still hungry.

My husband got a Groupon and thought we would try another Chinese place. You walk in and wonder if this place is a Chinese restaurant or a bar? It's a bar that serves terrible Chinese food. I completely agree with Tom M. It was the WORST tasting Chinese food ever! The place is dirty and toilets don't flush. They tell you to seat yourself when you walk in. The waitress seemed like she was on drugs. We would ask about certain food and she didn't know what to say about it. There were 4 kids (about 10-12 years old) playing with the pool table and throwing darts and hitting everything but the dart board. The employees nor the parents cared that the kids were running around screaming and being obnoxious. \\n\\nNow for the food, the only thing worth eating was the War Wonton soup. However, there was only three tasteless shrimps in two bowls of soup and we paid $10.00 for it. We got one order of Mongolian chicken. We usually get two when we go anywhere else, but since it was our first time there we decided to check it out first. We were so glad we did. It was so disgusting and where was the chicken? We got a heaping plate of onions and green chives. I had two bites and I was done. My husband looked for the chicken and ate the few pieces he found. I ordered two vegetarian egg/spring rolls. It was greasy and mushy on the inside. I had one bite and that was it. There was no filler like you would find in a regular egg roll. Oh, and the white rice. How can you go wrong with that???? Well, it was not like regular white rice. It was very small and sticky. I had maybe 5 bites. If you want soy sauce you can find the to-go packets. There is no bottle of soy sauce. We stuck with water, so that was safe...I think.\\n\\nWhen we were ready to go, I had to find the waitress. She forgot to take the Groupon off the bill, so we had to wait for that too. We left hungry, disappointed, and with a stomachache. It's also not good if you have acid reflux.  \\n\\nSo, if you want to go to a bar that looks scary and dirty, serves the worst Chinese food ever, gives you a stomachache, has horrible service and allows young kids to run around throwing darts and screaming, then this is the place to go! \\n\\nWhat a waste of time and money. You couldn't pay me enough to go back there...EVER! We are sticking with Flo's!!!"}

Across we discovered Pollo and said why not, nothing like a nicely seasoned chicken done over charcoal with a spicy zesty sauce to accompany it.. right? When we heard it was owned by Mozza as well, I figured; how could we go wrong.  What I need to know is how did Mozza go so wrong with this one.\\n\\nSeriously, where did they find the chef for this place, what a faker!  All I can say is everything was bland and if they tell you something is spicy, don't believe it.  Chicken is completely flavourless and is under cooked so you are fighting to get if off the bones.  The sauce it came with lacked any flavour and had the texture of heavy cream in you mouth.  Asked if she had something spicy and she told me the sauce was spicy. WTF... asked her to bring me something that had kick and luckily they did bring to my table a small bottle of Tabasco sauce, I had to put that shit on everything!!!  \\n\\nThe only thing that was really good here was the interior decor, but save your stash. If it's good Portuguese chicken you want, there is way better out there, starting with Romados, Jano and Braseiro just to name a few.

{"label": 3, "text": "Definitely would go back, only loses a star because some items on the menu are painfully overpriced - like PAIN..and not the good kind. But overall, the food is absolute delicious - and if you're not a pretentious portuguese little twat like some people who have written terrible reviews of this restaurant for no reason, you'll enjoy yourself. Get the beer on tap and anything with the \\\"home made piri piri sauce\\\" - both are insanely delicious.\\n\\nOrdered the lobster rolls and the crispy calamari to start - both delicious, both moderately priced. The calamari had an interesting batter to it, not one you would usually expect but we enjoyed it much more because of that!. There were 3 lobster rolls! which is a good portion for 14$ that's a pretty sweet deal.... ok, the lobster wasn't the freshest but it was really good anyways..suggestion! should any of the owners bother to read this review: can you indicate, for the love of piri piri, the AMOUNT you are getting for every menu item please. i though it was 1 lobster roll and my boyfriend had to ask the waiter about the rib and chicken plate for servings, also we made a mistake and over-ordered on desert - annoying -\\n\\nMains: chicken club with fries and salad and the bf took the chicken and ribs combo. Ribs were melt-in-yo-mouth but the sauce wasn't great. The chicken was delicious all-around. He had 2 drumsticks and the chicken in my club was a breast - all delicious and cooked to perfect tenderness. The piri piri sauce though - WOW. Good job on that, whoever makes it, I wanted to take some home, it was SO good.\\n\\nAs for the desert, we got Natas. My only problem was with the waiter: we made a mistake and ordered two orders of natas, we asked him to take one order out literally 30 seconds later and he said he couldnt do it because he already punched it in. The heat from his fingertips touching the touch screen cash hadn't even worn off when he told us this. desert cost us 16$ and we couldn't finish because it was too much food. This made me particularly mad because I've worked both in restaurants and retail and I know my way around a cash..you can delete an item soooo easily a caveman can do it and as for the chefs in the back...we literally asked as soon as he finished punching it in so really, there shouldn't have been a problem. If he was looking to add an extra menu item - he succeeded, if he was looking for tip - fat chance - that was a complete dick move but then again, I don,t expect much from Laval service staff - tips and ass on a stick for the waitresses and meat-for-brains waiters.\\n\\nOther than that, great time and great food!"}

{"label": 3, "text": "During honeymoon and spell of marital bliss we used to frequent this Mexican eatery in Chicago. As soon we were seated two Sombreros with ten gallon hats would come and serenade out table with \\\"Guantanamera.-Wahila Gauntanamera\\\"  I advocate this for any newly married since the tequila was intoxicating, the music lilting and the food was delicious and we couldn't wait to get to our nest.. This was the old days. Circa 2013, Las Vegas (Spanish for The Meadows)  is inundated with  Mexican restaurants in every corner and the one with the good ambiance somehow don't make it in Vegas (people don't seem to have class or taste anymore?). The Mexican food scene is changing to Food Trucks in every gas station and there is no room for ten gallon hats.\\n\\nSo when you hear about a new classy Mexican eatery you are attracted to it specially when it is authentic Mexican food., This location was previously  Elephant Bar, Inca and then El Patron. They all failed not to the poor location-no traffic after dark hence not enough dinner crowd.. But El Patron closed not because of the traffic but a victim of recession. \\n\\nHacienda Del Ray, is probably the Best Ethnic Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas. This is not for Gringos who frequent taco bell and other bells or hyped up Mexican eateries who serve cheap and massive plates filled with sourcream and cheese and more oil than the spill in Alaska, but for some one who appreciate good food, the cleanliness and ambiance and even patio dining. and there are not many Mexican places with patio dining. They need good entertainment to draw the Gringos. Karaoke draws a cheap crowd and one of the singers sounded  like mating call of sea urchin,\\n\\nI tried \\\"Fajita Hacienda\\\" with Chicken, Shrimp and Steak. and it was outstanding not to underestimate the Margarita on the rocks-the frozen was so so. I hope this place makes it since it is owned by a chain and they have money to spend on advertising and promotion. The service was excellent and If I write too much it will sound like I am patronizing which I am not. I find out this is a franchise and they have branches in Westchester, CA and Playa Del Ray, CA. And that is a Plus."}

We were greeted by three employes who explained the menu.  Between my family and I we had a mushroom swiss burger, regular cheeseburger and a chipotle black bean vegetarian burger all made into combos.  So this place presents itself as a fast casual restaurant but I find a few things that do not warrant above fast-food prices.  I ordered the veggie burger and asked for a gluten free bun...sorry try again, so I ask for my burger to be wrapped in lettuce instead.  When we get our baskets I notice right away that my burger had a leaf of iceberg lettuce on the top and bottom to emulate a bun.  A famous Southern California fast-food burger chain does a much better job at wrapping burgers at a fraction of the cost.  The black bean patty is tough to get wrong since it comes out of their freezer.  The mushroom swiss had plenty of cheese and mushrooms on it but the patty was bland with no seasoning, this goes for the regular cheeseburger as well.  One of our combos had fried zucchini in place of fries...guess what frozen too with a hint of freezer burn.  Before our meal made it out to us we get our drinks.  We have a choice of a self serve fountain soda machine with the standard fare or brewed ice tea.  As I stated above the place was open for 1.5 hours, I go for the ice tea naturally.  I have a ritual when getting tea, I always pour a sip into my cup to ensure it's not old and nasty.  When pouring my sample sip I see tea of course but am surprised to see tea grounds along with the filter...pretty gross.  \\n\\nOK I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt that it was a bad day and will give them one more shot sometime down the road.

Well that's what both their chocolate and vanilla shakes taste like. Awful. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself. Clean, well lit, and a little crowded with too many tables. It's next door to a nail salon and so it has that nasty ass acrylic odor creeping in from next door. Not so much creeping as it's almost overpowering.

I spoke to someone here, the 2nd highest rated on Yelp, who told me they had availability tomorrow (12/21) at 9AM, asked my last name & dog's name, and I got off the phone happy that they were going to be able to fit our dog in.  This morning (12/21) my boyfriend reluctantly got up out of a warm bed to make it to the 9AM appointment.  He called me minutes later to say he was told rather forcefully that he had the wrong place, we had no appointment.  After checking my call log, the Yelp page where I got the phone number, the length of time of the call, I called back the same number I had called the day before to make the appointment.  The same woman answered, when I told her that my boyfriend had just been turned away for not having an appointment, she was VERY rude to me, telling me that I must have called a place across the street because SHE is the ONLY one who makes appointments and I had NEVER called her because she would REMEMBER if someone had called with a dog named BANANA.  When I tried to insist that it was the second of two places I had called yesterday, that I know it's the place I called, she continued to be rude to me.  I have sent over screen caps of my call log, the information of the length of our phone call, and a screen cap of the Yelp review where I got the phone number showing her business name & address.  I will be very curious to see what the response is, as she was ADAMANT that I was wrong.  Methinks good business practice would be, even if she didn't recall making the appointment, to ask how she might accommodate us or at least suggest (rather than insist) that we may have the wrong place rather than act like WE are the crazy ones.

We went into the shop and were told there is a 10% off services if we did Mani and Pedi's together. My dad had the best person there. My mom had the owner's wife and she did a horrible job, didn't clip toe nails short enough, argued with my mom on why she could not shorten them. Polish was messy and left on the toe skin around the nail, heels were left ragged and looked like she had never been to get her feet done. My son is 13, they left his toe nails ingrown and too long. Scrubbed so hard with the loofah he had blisters on his feet. When it was my turn, I went for ingrown toe nails and left with them still hurting. The guy sort of trimmed my toe nails. When I asked for shorter, he told me they were fine? Skin around my toes were left with clip marks, polish was left on my skin, no clean up with a brush in polish remover. At the end of the pedicures, the owner did not show me the totals where she had removed the 10% discount, gave a number out of the air. Good business starts with being honest with your clients! Shop is dirty, smells like mildew and rotten food. Doors are dirty, floors slippery, dust and cobwebs hanging from ceiling. Health Department needs to visit this shop. It's disgusting!!!

She proceeded to finish ripping off the wax cloth and afterwards I felt like my eyelids (not under my brow, my actual eyelid cuz I think too much wax was put on) was on fire! She again said it was my skin and not the wax. So later that day I looked at my eyes and they were red and scabbing from being burnt. :( I'm not usually a person that complains but I went back there to tell them and the owners wife told me it's my skin not the wax.

Like most Marriott properties this location is clean, well maintained and staffed by friendly and courteous people. This location is pretty new (in fact, I had to add it to Yelp!) so it's still in fantastic shape. When you look at the alternatives in a 3-5 mile radius, this is by far the nicest option available - even compared to the Courtyard further down Independence. The rooms are always quiet and are very clean; beds are comfortable and the climate control units are pretty quiet. If you're feeling like splurging the king jacuzzi suites are pretty fantastic and the jacuzzi looks like it's actually cleaned properly. Breakfast is what you would expect from a Marriott.\\n\\nThis location sits back off of Independence a bit, so it gets less road noise than you might expect given it's location. It's accessible from either Independence or from Sardis Rd if you turn into the Chili's lot and drive behind the restaurant.\\n\\nI live here in Charlotte, but my wife and I frequently take date a night out while the grandparents watch the kids, or we take \\\"personal recovery days\\\" away and each spend a night out relaxing. This is our new go-to spot after trying many of the other Marriott properties in Charlotte. It's close to home, close to dining and is extremely clean.\\n\\nOnly downside is that, like with most Marriott properties, the Market is extremely overpriced and there aren't a lot of alternatives in the nearby area for finding a snack or a beverage. Sure, you can go to the restaurant, but if you want a drink in your room, be prepared for the exorbitant cost of the Marriott Market."}

And the wonderful spring rolls. \\n\\nAs the other reviews have noted, not much atmosphere ( I may take my iPod speakers next time). The server is extremely friendly and helpful. When we had dinner there the last time, I had mixed my pork and veges and noodles as your supposed to do, But she stopped by and put the rest of my sauce (kind of a light dressing) on my food and motioned to mix it more. I bet she wanted to help me and do it herself. Very cute."}

The spring rolls were okay, but the peanut sauce was watery. I had the Bun, and the meat tasted like it was cooked leftovers. You can hear the waitress back in the kitchen putting everything in the microwave. Maybe if they had some sort of music, you wouldn't be able to hear that. We come down from Sedona and enjoy having pho when we come to town.  I definitely won't be coming back to this one."}

{"label": 3, "text": "Went here for lunch today and enjoyed it a lot! As other's have mentioned, the area isn't that great and the parking in the back seems a bit shady (i.e. I wouldn't want to be there after dark, alone) but during the day it was fine. Walking from the behind parking, I appreciated the signs leading you to the entrance. So many places don't do that! It was an interesting walk with lots of salvage yard items laying around. I noticed a sign that said 10% off with a check but didn't see anything with price tags so not too sure if items were sale...even though it seemed to me just a lot of scrap stuff. \\n\\nThe house was quirky and cute on the inside with plenty of tables and lots of mismatched chairs and knickknacks on the shelves. I didn't notice any paint smell as Jason L reported in July so that was good! \\n\\nWe were greeted as soon as we walked in and got to pick where we sat. We ordered some ice waters since it was so hot!!! and thankfully it was clean tasting filtered water (something so important in Phoenix!) in some mason jars. All the sandwiches sounded great but ultimately I decided on the turkey sandwich with their funky sauce, lettuce, tomato, jalepeno and avocado since she said it was their most popular. My fiance got the Thanksgiving sandwich. I ordered a side of the pesto macaroni salad and he got the fruit with chili. All of the food was really good! I enjoyed my sandwich a lot and liked the extra flavor from the sauce. Both breads were really good and soft and the stuffing on the Turkey Thanksgiving was really good. As Andrew V mentioned that it didn't taste any different than what he had as a kid. Man, he must have had good sandwiches as a kid! :) If you want uninspired sandwiches, try Lady Bug house of sandwiches. Now that was a sandwich I could have made at home! I thought there were several sandwiches that sounded really good with unique flavors that I would have never thought of. PB, Bacon and Bananas? I may have to try that one next time!\\n\\nOur waitress was really friendly and said they had been open for 5 months. When we got our bill for $15 I didn't even use the 10% off for checking in on Yelp. I thought they deserved the $1.50! Overall, I'd love to come back and try more of their sandwiches! Score downtown with another place for a good lunch!"}

The ingredients were fresh, the bread was the perfect mix of soft with a little bit of a crust, and the funky sauce was delicious.\\n\\nIn addition, the owner is fantastic and it was apparent that she truly loves what she does and cares about providing exceptional food and service. We're absolutely sold on the Funky Food Shack and can't wait to go back again and again until we've tried everything on the menu and I highly recommend that you do the same!"}

Apparently they are owned by the same people but are trying to bring in a younger crowd with a creative flair to drinks and food.  The patio was really well built and pleasing to the eye; there are a few flat screens and they have large speakers always playing music.  I have to add that the music playlist was pretty terrible though.  Service was top notch and everything tasted great!  I really enjoyed the interesting combinations the chef came up with; nothing disappointed.  They also have a good selection of spirits, and I thought it was pretty neat that there was an option for bourbon flights.  \\n\\nThis place can be pretty spendy so be prepared for that, but I thought the experience and quality of food was worth the money."}

Then again, I was sitting with Michael Monti last night, and that might have gathered me a little extra attention. But everyone looked like they were  getting great service, too.\\n\\nSituated on the north side of Monti's La Casa Vieja should keep the sun at bay this summer.

Our food was a bit late in coming out, we did not mention it.  He brought our bill and gave us happy hour prices to compensate.  The food was perfect for a patio.  I had the sonorand dog, tasty.

I checked the temperature on my phone it was a very uncomfortable 97 degrees so that was a little weird.  We sat down and had the kobe beef sliders and a glass of red wine.  My wine was $8 or $9 cant remember other than it being on the more expensive side for how horrible and warm it was.  I didn't expect the wine to be warm.  That was a first for me, warm wine yuck.  I mean really warm not just room temp warm we are talkin warm warm.  I didnt think there was anything special about the sliders.

{"label": 3, "text": "While strolling down the north end of Mill Ave from Tempe Town Lake I was accosted by the smell of grilling beef coming from Monti's La Casa Vieja Steakhouse.  I changed my plans and crossed the street to Monti's where I was greeted outside by a young woman who said something unintelligible but obviously polite.\\n\\nI asked to sit at the new outside porch area. She then explained that the outside had a different menu, different drinks and a different vibe than inside--though a common owner. \\n\\nI chose to sit outside. She immediately recommended the prime rib quesadilla, \\\"it's my favorite on the outside menu.\\\"\\n\\nI was disappointed at the menu.  It seemed a bit limited and not the traditional fare that I was used to at the old Monti's inside.\\n\\nSo I sat down and ordered the quesadilla.  The server said, \\\"that's my favorite on this menu.\\\"  When another man delivered my food (complete with a white and purple flower on the corner) he said, \\\"this is my favorite on the menu.\\\" \\n\\nMy thought was that Michael Monti must have trained these parrots well.\\n\\nMy plate looked like some slightly greasy quesadilla slices with hand cut corn on top, and a flower on the side.\\n\\nThen I ate it.\\n\\nAnd, holy crap, it may be the tastiest item I've ever had on Mill Ave.\\n\\nA server asked a customer nearby how his meal was and just walked right by me. I demanded his attention and, without much acknowledgement, he said, \\\"I'm not even going to ask you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I told him. \\\"They really are that good.\\\"\\n\\nI won't describe all the ingredients, but the words that come to mind are these: \\\"Cacophony becomes symphony.\\\"\\n\\nSo, if you venture out to my adopted home of Mill Ave drop by Monti's Tempe Front Porch and ask for the Prime Rib Quesadilla. \\n\\nDon't expect anyone to ask if you enjoyed them."}

{"label": 0, "text": "Tempe Front Porch get ready to be put on blast!!!!..... Well first of all we planned on going to Monti's for lunch, didn't realize that TFP isn't actually Monti's, but we wanted to sit outside. We got there at 2:40 for a late lunch, sat down, waited about 20min to finally see our server(Samantha) and place a drink order. We saw her walk by atleast 10 times without saying anything to us (and that's rounding down, prob was more like 15 times), along with all the other servers walking by numerous times with no help. Luckily the hostess was nice enough to bring us waters after she saw we hadn't been helped the first 10min. So after I finally got my beer it had been 35min since we sat down. Food came out relatively quick, tasted great. Yet for some reason our aunts soup and salad took the longest and came out 5min after all of the other entrees. Never got any water refills, or asked if we wanted more drinks. Heck we barely even saw her to ask for more drinks or water. Then when we were ready for our bill, didn't see her for a while, probably about 20min or so of when we were ready for our bill until she finally brought it to us. \\nSo I'm guessing this was Samantha's first shift?? Or first ever serving job?? Really wish we had just stayed inside and had lunch at Monti's. Definitely never going to sit on the crappy patio again. The while experience was a joke. If my wife and I weren't with family we would've definitely walked out whole we were waiting 20min for a server to help us."}

{"label": 2, "text": "I started going here when they first opened and they were great! Everything was very fresh. Portions and pricing were descent and I loved getting the dressing tossed in the salad.  I always got the tilapia because I don't like, as previous mentioned, the protein selection (packaged/fake grill marks). However, I recently noticed quality/freshness had diminished and prices have gone up. \\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\nGet rid of the microwave!! At least put it in the back so I don't see you microwave the frozen tilapia I order! Invest in a grill and quality will skyrocket. \\n\\nThe soup used to be made fresh daily and served from a pot. Now it's stored in a cooler where they also place in the microwave when you order. Chicken noodle  is delicious but a little salty. \\n\\nStaff is always short-handed. They need to hire at least 1 more person between 11-1pm and 5-7pm because service is so slow (not the fault of the employee)! I usually go in with another person and it takes us at least 15 min to get our food. \\n\\nHopefully, the owner takes a look at this and makes some changes. I really want this place to stay open, considering there aren't very many quick/healthy places for lunch/dinner.\\n\\nI will still go back and enjoy a salad from time to time, but with these changes I would probably go back everyday!

Some of these new meds are very hard to find, not to mention very pricey. My pharmacy since 2009 has always been Rte Aid , but after my Home-Health Nurse manager recommended this family owned and operated pharmacy that picks up prescriptions AND delivers the meds right to your doorstep, for FREE!! I totally switched pharmacies with the blink of an eye! Of course the pick-ups and deliveries are a great feature that not every pharmacy has, but its a great feature for those who are truly unable to drive or unable to do so due to health reasons or old age. Im sure this feature is offered to those  within a certain mile-radius though.\\nThe owner/Pharmacist is Sameer Shah, who operates the entire show along with his Pharmacy Tech Jose, together they get things done like no other. Some of my meds are very rare and hard to get 'pre-authorization' from my insurance because of its hefty price for each tablet. At this point I was still with Rite Aid and needed my meds desperately, and since they were waiting for the approval, I was without my meds for well over a week and a half. Everytime I called they'd say \\\"we're working on it\\\", but nothing. Before things got any worse, my nurse suggested I transfer my prescriptions to Care First. Upon doing so, Sameer immediately got to work and hounded the insurance company until they approved it......within 2 days!! What took Rite Aid over a week & 1/2 (and still no results) Sameer accomplished in 2 days. Now thats dedication to his clients. \\n\\nIve been very happy since switching pharmacies, he is super friendly, very knowledgable and genuinely caring. I also like that its family owned/operated, those of you who know me, know I go out of my way to support such businesses rather than give my money to the multi-million dollar chains. \\nCare First accepts all kinds of insurances including medicare and medicaid, you may even save more $$ if you have those money-saving prescription cards that give deep discounts (but call to confirm first).\\nIts located in the same complex where you'll find 'A Piece of Havana', Papa Johns, Kumon and Gold's Gym.\\n\\np.s: just tell him the young lady with the cane sent you!

First, the cashier was very helpful, but was trying to sell me things that were not gluten free when I already told her I was gluten free.  This was in response to them being out of fries...on a weekend night.  How are you out of fries when a large part of your menu is fish and chips?\\n\\nThen, the wait.  We were one of five tables, all of which had their food when we ordered, and it took over 20 minutes to get our food.  This seems like a long time for a restaurant where you go up to a cashier and order.  Plus, about ten minutes into our wait, a line began to form.  This line didn't move until we got our food 10 minutes later.  Expect to wait in line and for your food.\\n\\nThe service...was terrible.  The girl that served us our food was snotty and rude.  This was our first time there and when we asked her a question, she gave us a terrible attitude.  Then, we asked the manager about the asian fish.  He talked about the wasabe marinade/coating on the fish, we weren't sure what it was but it was missing.  He was arguing that we should've known and told him that it was missing.  We only figured this out after we told him it had no flavor and he told us it has lots of flavor, but he couldn't understand that it wasn't on the fish. How were we going to know it was missing when it was our first time there.  They were also out of the salad dressing we ordered.\\n\\nOverall, the food is okay, but the service, cost, and wait times will prevent us from returning.

You also get the cole slaw and tomatoes and onions.  I never eat all my brown rice.  I was glad that the second time I got it, the amount of rice was smaller, I still left about half of it on the plate.  I am a portion conscious person and I think the piece of fish is really big.  My hubby had the seafood salad and it was delicious, I stole one of his grilled shrimp.  The first time the wait was a little long, but it was the first week they were open.

Door handle was sticky.  No one greeted, and we had to wait for counterhelp.  \\n\\nWall mounted menu vague, and little explaination offered. First impressions make it harder to set an enjoyable experience.  More of a order at a counter-fast food type of dining, not at all like accolades posted from Zagat on walls (obviously not this location).  A bit pricey for fast food style... $30.  for two drinks, a fish sandwich and a cup of chowder.\\n\\nFood brought out,  and handler made commentary on how my companion had asked her fish burger be prepared.  She is diet restricted and did not have coleslaw or tartar sauce on her sandwich.  He had to finish with a shot that her food looked 'weird' to him.  Not appropriate.  \\n\\nThe slaw/salad I ordered was on a melamite dish, sloppy and runny... And the chowder was in another non-New England style rendition of New England style fish chowder.  I was rather ambitious, I suppose, ordering same from a Hawaiian motif establishment... My bad.  \\n\\nOverall, a pass on experience.  My food was ok, served as fast food is.  Fish was ok, bun was dried out, and really not anything better than a fast food chain fish sandwich.

{"label": 0, "text": "So after seeing all of the race reviews and having driven by this little place, thought we would go see what it was all about. Upon first walking in the door you are greeted by a strong coconut smell. Not bad. And sort of expected. But strong. Then we walked up to the counter where who we can assume was the manager was arguing on the phone with someone and didn't give us a second glance. The cashier walked by us and said we would be helped in a moment. So we looked over a very undescriptive menu. To our right was another employee eating their food. To our left was the owner. When the cashier came back we told her it was our first time there and then she told us \\\"well then wait a second\\\" while she left to talk to the employee eating. We stood there and waited until she came back and half heatedly tried to explain the menu options, only confusing us. I wound up ordering the fish burger and my mother had the \\\"new England clam chowder\\\". I'll get to that in a second. So while this happened the manager is still arguing and the owner is on his laptop. So I go and get some \\\"iced tea\\\". Which apparently translates to \\\"Luke warm tea\\\". It was so nasty and left a weird taste in my mouth. I've had that brand before and always liked it. So I was surprised. All of the tables were filthy, despite the employees hanging around and the lack of any customers besides ourselves. There was trash pieces on the floor. We essentially bused our own table before we could even sit down. Then when our food finally arrived I was told that I basically ordered my food incorrectly for asking there to be no tartar sauce. Not one but two employees came to tell me so. I don't like tartar sauce. On the walls are all of these praises from varying sources! So I thought \\\"well the food should be good!\\\" Upon closer inspection all of the framed reviews are from their Hawaii location. Not the Scottsdale one. Seemed kind of weird to us. But oh well it's a new location, right? All of numbers are super worn and faded and the drink machines look crazy old. Well maybe they were saving money for the decor? So I take a bite of my fish burger and the bread instantly tastes chalky. The fish was alright so I ate that instead. My mom had the chowder and the coleslaw. The coleslaw was bland and gross. Just like cabbage with a cream over it. The chowder tasted like it came from a can. And it had tomatoes. Which is really weird. I was born and raised in boston. I had never seen a \\\"new England style\\\" chowder with tomatoes. So we picked at our food. Cleared our plates. Bused our table. Again. Then slowly made our way to the door. We were completely ignored. No one said goodbye, or even acknowledged we had been there. Bottom line: won't be going back. The establishment wasn't even slightly impressive. We talked about our concerns next to the eating employee who stared at us then walked away completely ignoring what we had said to her."}

Th food is prepared fresh and the quality of the ingredients is very apparent.    Prices while not cheap are a bit misleading since the proportions are ample and 2 tacos to an order will fill you up.   We have visited 5-6 times and the place has just gotten better each time.  Our initial trip soon after opening was not nearly as efficient as have been the most recent trips.   The staff we found to be excellent and the facility is spotless even when they were very busy.\\n\\nFish tacos and the fish burger are clearly our favorites.

I agree wholeheartedly with Mike O.'s review from a month ago.  Ono is dry and too dense.  Can't hold on to the taco without it falling apart.  I can think of several places with better fish tacos so I do not understand what the fuss is all about.  If you like a better fish taco at a good price in this area, go to Habeneros.  It is a shame Rumbies is now out of business, it was a far superior meal at a better price.  If you think paying $11 for a 2 mediocre fish tacos is acceptable, then go ahead and try it.

{"label": 1, "text": "Went there with three members of the Family today, and here is the lowdown from what we had to eat:\\n\\nBlackened fish sandwiches were pretty darn good.  Generous portion and well seasoned.  Tartar sauce is dill-based and quite good.\\n\\nDid not try the fish tacos, and I hear they are good from other family that turned us on to this place.\\n\\nHere are my issues.  On the outside of the store there is a huge sign on the canopy that states:  \\\"All of our food is made from scratch\\\".  From \\\"scratch\\\".\\n\\nThat is simply not true.  I had the shrimp and chips basket, and the shrimp was described as butterflied and lightly battered.  Sounds good, no?  Well hate to break it to ya, but they were clearly frozen and from their local restaurant supply place.  Don't believe me?  Others have placed examples of the aforementioned shrimp in the pics section.  Have a look.  I have had these at countless chains across the country, and can spot them a mile away.  Likely TESCO or shamrock delivered.  Uninspired at best.\\n\\nAlso, french fries- Frozen Shoestring, Mickey D's style\\nAlso , onion rings-  Frozen Beer battered style \\n\\n(I was fine with both of these being frozen, and there was an ample amount of both.)\\n\\nWhat I DO have a problem with them stating that EVERYTHING is from scratch, when it is clearly not.\\n\\nAlso, their \\\"famous\\\" cole slaw was bland, practically tasteless on its own.  It fared better on the really well done fish sandwiches.\\n\\nI am not by any means a \\\"power\\\" reviewer on this site, but I am being honest here.  Fix your breaded shrimp and do them the right way.  Not that hard, and likely cheaper in the long run.  \\n\\nOR, change that sign out front because it is not indicative of what is happening with some of your food.  Not going to one star this review because of the excellent service and fish sandwich.  I hope you guys do well, but be honest or change a couple of things."}

We didn't realize that you're supposed to get your own silver, napkins, condiments, etc. \\n\\nWe ordered 3 mains, 3 appetizers, and 2 beers and a tea, and the bill before tip came to over $82.00 which gave us all a little shock. We didn't have a problem with the bill; most places in Scottsdale are about this price BUT usually, the places that charge $20 or more per person also include table service and a set table. \\n\\nWe had the calamari appetizer, the coconut shrimp appetizer, fish tacos, fish & chips, and a chowder. The calamari was excellent, the coconut shrimp was very decent (good dipping sauce-sweet/spicy but I suspect frozen). My dad loved his tacos, my mom not so much (she felt like they could have put more fish and less fluff cabbage on it, especially since you're paying over 10 bucks for just two tacos). I loved my fish (great breading on the mahi!) but the chips were obviously frozen shoestring potatoes that they had fried up on order. Don't get me wrong, they tasted decent enough but maybe they shouldn't say everything is made from scratch when it isn't....My husband thought the chowder was nothing special as it tasted like canned chowder soup that they had tossed previously frozen seafood bits into and doctored up. My folks couldn't stop raving about the beers though!\\n\\nThe food was out to us in under 10 minutes after ordering which surprised us as the dining area was full of people. We had food runner (maybe a supervisor of sorts?) who was nice enough to grab silver and etc for us but he was BAKED. (red eyes, delay in reaction, awkward interactions-the guy was not only baked but was something closed to SUPER baked :P). The guy was really nice but it was pretty darn obvious. \\n\\nThe food was really good but the casual atmosphere just doesn't match the price points that they have going and almost serves as a deterrent from going on the regular.

Now after my first visit, I don't quite get why this place gets so much hype, and why my coworker is crazy about it!\\n\\n6 of us stopped by for lunch around 11 and no wait! The line starts getting long around 11:30. We all ordered the fish or chiken taco mountain, quite pricy in my opinion, but the plate is huge! I guess they measured it by the amount of food. It really looked like a mountain, not in the nicest presentation, all the fish, veggies, sauce, and rice are mixed together, the fish, however, was very dry and flavor-less, i hate to say, the only thing I enjoyed was the mango salsa. I barely finished half of the plate and was so stuffed! \\n\\nThe place does offer a cool decor where the tables are in the shape of surf boards, interior lighting is bright, a clean and simple setup. But for the food, sorry, I would rather pay less and get a burrito bowl from chipotle!"}

{"label": 3, "text": "Close your eyes and imagine waking up on the beach of a tropical island. You see palm trees lilting back and forth in a gentle breeze like tall, proud hula dancers from an age long past. As you lie on the white sand and let the salty waves ease you from your slumber, you hear steel drums and the melodic hum of a dozen islanders approaching you. Soon they surround you and lift you up on a magnificent litter made of woven palm fronds and a kaleidoscope of soft feathers. The islanders set you down in the shade of the swaying palms and begin to rub your body with warm hunks of wild boar lard. As they grease your arms and legs, more islanders begin feeding you delicate morsels of grilled white fish. In between your heavenly bites, attendants pour sweet, nourishing milk into your mouth from halved coconuts, not bothering to wipe up the excess drops that dribble down your chin, slowly collecting on your chest in an pale pool. Before long, your skin is covered in a soothing blend of coconut milk, pig fat, and briny ocean water. Grains of sand and flakes of fish stick out from your hair like the trappings of some ancient sea sprite. You lie back down on the sand and doze in perfect contentment.\\n\\nNow open your eyes. That's about what it's like to eat at Coconut's Fish Cafe."}

I think that is mostly just because they are more popular now, the place was crowded and extremely loud. The service was good. They did bring out the wrong order, but fixed it right away.\\n\\nI got veggie tacos, which is probably one of my favorite foods, so of course I liked it. My bf got fish tacos and they were ready abnormally fast, which made him curious. Also he said his tortilla tasted kind of too hard, like maybe it was old or overcooked. I did not have that issue though, mine were fine. Liked the salsa on top, and the veggie patty is pretty tasty. Small portions for how pricey it is though. Left wanting another taco, or a little snack..which is crazy for a $12 meal. Also don't like that the two tacos are served on separate plates, just don't get it!\\n\\nI do really like the decor of this place, very cute with the surfboard tables and Hawaiian feel. Also it is clean which is a big plus. Coconuts is alright in my book, would probably like it better if I ate fish haha. This restaurant was something different, but not really a personal favorite for me."}

{"label": 2, "text": "My girlfriend took me to this place because I love a good fish taco! Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. Though I shouldn't judge the place based off of one experience. The restaurant was busy when we arrived but they did a great job of handling the customers in line. The cashier was patient and friendly. We were able to order almost right away. I of course went with the fish taco combo. I was a little concerned that the rice and beans were a separate charge. My girlfriend told me the tacos were huge so I trusted her and didn't order the sides.\\n\\nBought a soda and the carbonation was off. The Dr. Pepper tasted flat and lacked that joyous bubbly fizz we all love. The tacos were ready almost as soon as I sat down. At first I was impressed! However, I was a little concerned about the speediness of the food. Had my food been sitting back there under a heat lamp waiting to be served? I'm not sure. All I know is I ordered my meal after her and she had veggie tacos. So how was my fish ready first? They weren't cold but they weren't hot off the grill either. They also brought her the wrong meal, I laughed when they put down fish and chips instead of her usual vegetarian/healthy obsessed dishes. The corn tortilla was stiff like it had been cooked too long or sat awhile. My girlfriend said hers was soft so not sure what  happened to mine. I did enjoy the mango salsa that came with the tacos. Added in a sweet and salty kinda taste to the meal. Not enough to put it in my top taco list though.\\n\\nI finished both tacos and was still hungry! I'm all about portion management, but very rarely do I leave a restaurant still hungry. Especially when paying 13+ for the meal already. I'm not frugal, I just like reasonable prices for what I eat. My girlfriend was sweet and offered to buy me another taco but decided to save that extra space for dessert elsewhere! I'd probably go back and give it another shot since I'm a reasonable person, but with other better places to try it may be awhile!"}

As a Seattle native, I am picky, and getting fish at restaurants in a land locked state always gives me the heebies unless I go to a 5 star restaurant. This little joint opened up right down the road from my house and lemme tell you, so worth it. First off, the gentleman working behind the counter was awesome. Seriously, this guy loves his job and it is so apparent. He asked if it was my first time then went through all the ingredients in their tacos, what makes them special, and recommendations. Didn't even sound canned, just authentic. I ended up getting the fish tacos (two tacos, so massive) and the seafood chowder. Both unbelievably delicious. Coconuts gets this pacific northwesterner's stamp of approval. I am a customer for life, thanks guys for such a great experience."}

The booth where we were seated had a large outdoor sign tucked behind it which awkwardly stuck out during our meal. The seating layout is also very strange. The good news is that the food was really good and they deliver. I think I may order delivery from them, but wouldn't dine in again.

Diet Coke was flat, I tried to let the server know that they needed to check the carbonation but she wasn't understanding me so I told her I would have water instead.\\n\\nPho came out quickly.  I asked for 1) a spoon (yes, need a spoon for the broth, thanks), 2) for cilantro and onions.  I got what would amount to about 1 sprig of cilantro and some green onions.  Realized after I got the smidgen of cilantro that they hadn't served the side of sprouts, basil, jalapenos, etc on the side... At this point I will just have to make do.\\n\\nYounger server came to check on me so I ask her for more cilantro as well as jalapenos/limes (which would normally have already been served on the side).  She explains that they don't bring the veggies with the \\\"chicken noodle soup\\\" because there are already veggies in the soup and most people don't eat the sprouts, etc.  Fair enough, I usually don't eat the sprouts either, but I always use the limes and jalapenos and lots of cilantro so please bring me some, thank you.\\n\\nOut she comes with more cilantro (more than a sprig which was nice) and jalapenos.  No lime though.  I've given up at this point and used the lime from my water.\\n\\nAfter adding the cilantro, jalapeno and watery lime, the pho was much better (pretty bland otherwise) and it satisfied my pho craving, but can't say that I'll be back in the future, at least not for pho.  \\n\\nI know this is a lot of detail and maybe sounds a little picky for just a bowl of soup, but honestly, pho is not that complicated and certain things are just standard and they didn't deliver those \\\"standards\\\" here.\\n\\nThe decor was very nice and the second server really did try to make me happy, but all in all there other places I much prefer."}

I was seated immediately, and my server was quite lovely, finding the line between conversational and professional, anticipating my needs and leaving me alone to enjoy my food. \\n\\nHowever, I appreciated that they boxed my food themselves, and better yet they even asked me if I wanted more rice to go, and if I wanted it with the meal or boxed separately. \\n\\nFood - Ordered spring rolls, Vietnamese iced coffee, and cashew chicken. Spring rolls were fresh and tasty, but nothing overtly special. The iced coffee was a bit bland, but the server came back and asked me if it was sweet enough. She took it to the back and got more condensed milk, so that was a big help. The coffee is pretty mixed before it gets to the table, so there was no satisfaction of slugging down a little condensed milk beforehand. \\n\\nDrink menu is on the table, not in the menu, so be aware. \\n\\nCashew chicken was very tasty. Vegetables were cooked to the right crispness, and chicken was lean with no fat to be seen! You can tell this dish was made fresh and not just reheated. \\n\\nPrice - 20$ for drink, appetizer, and entr\\u00e9e (plus 25% tip) is not too bad. \\n\\n\\nOverall - Great little place if you want some good Asian food fast and cheap.

{"label": 3, "text": "Firstoff, this event is cheap as hell. It is more economical than the cost of a regular ole' concert these days. That has to be taken into account by Yelpers reviewing right? Right? \\n\\nApparently not for this listing. Reviewers expect Coachella VIP climate-controlled restrooms, golf carts -- complete with complementary champagne --  to zip you from stage to stage, and hologram performances of all their favourite rockers from yesteryear, all for 17$ (including LET). Get real. \\n\\nYou are not going to run into Lindsey Lohan, Paris Hilton, or Danny DeVito here. \\n\\nI must say before I continue that my lone experience with this event is the 2013 iteration. I cannot judge it to Extreme Things of the past. I will not judge it with major music festivals because entry to this event did not set me back 300$ USD.  I had thought about going in past years but there were always conflicting shows and Extreme Thing did not win out. In any case, this year's ET was an enjoyable time for me. \\n\\nI heard everyone I wanted to hear this year: The Aquabats! (who alone I have paid in excess of the ticket price for ET) and Sage Francis, who I had never heard live as far as I can remember (too many hip hop festival memories live in a haze) and who absolutely was worth the price of admission by himself (and then some). \\n\\nCould it be better? Yeah. \\nIs it good enough for 17$-20$? Uh, have you purchased a concert ticket in the last ten years?\\n\\nThere are no in-and-outs, and I mean the practice of coming in and out of gates, not the fast food establishment. Big fucking deal. Plan ahead. The individuals complaining -- and there were many -- clearly have internet capabilities in order to go all over the world wide webs griping about the (new?) policy. So they could have checked the website and seen that it CLEARLY stated that there were no ins and outs before attending this year.\\n\\nThey do not allow food or refillable water bottles either, but I easily snuck in the former and they let pass the latter because it was plastic (with the explicit directive not to take it out [which I did not until I was at the water fountain filling up or when drinking; in other words, I took it out]). \\n\\nThis is a good little music festival for the price they charge for admission. - E"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Oh, concerts.  I feel like there was a point in time when they weren't so terrible to go to.\\n\\nI've been to Extreme Thing before a few years back, so I was expecting something similar to that this year - essentially, like Warped Tour with a decent atmosphere and plenty of space for attendees and stages.\\n\\nHow times change.\\n\\nThe event is a steal at $20 for a ticket and free parking for an all-day concert fest jam-packed with rad rock/alternative/metal bands.  That's kind of where the awesome stops.\\n\\nNot only is it overcrowded now but the old person in me may be starting to creep out - concert \\\"kids\\\" are just douchey these days.  They have zero consideration for anyone as they just push or walk without looking because they're too busy browsing/posting on Facebook/Instagram.  And do you really need to post a status every couple of minutes on the band you're watching literally 20 feet in front of you?  Oh, and record EVERY. SINGLE. SONG?  Get over yourselves.  I am trying to watch a concert that doesn't involve viewing it through your crappy iPhone.\\n\\nI can't even drown myself in booze as there is no alcohol allowed at the event.\\n\\nAside from a horrible scene, the food is mediocre at best with no place to really sit and the vendors this year compared to a few years ago were just bad with nothing of interest.\\n\\nThe stages were significantly smaller, too - they put Taking Back Sunday on a stage that's probably half to three-fourths the size of House of Blues' stage.  Which, by the way, was supposed to be Extreme Thing's \\\"main stage.\\\"  Yeah, no.  It really wasn't.\\n\\nHad it not been for one of my favorite bands from my avid concert-going years, Finch, I probably wouldn't have bothered this year.

{"label": 2, "text": "It is always nice to see a new spot pop up in my neck of the woods. The Milton-Parc district a.k.a McGill Ghetto and its adjacent strip of Saint-Laurent street presents some interesting options to check out and I certainly have my regular locales (I have mentioned how much I LOVE Icehouse?) Last week, SuWu neighborhood bar opened up replacing the now departed Cafeteria right by the corner of St-Laurent and Prince Arthur. I saw some pictures of the media event they hosted and decided that I definitely needed to try the interesting food and drinks that they were serving.\\n\\nI sadly didn't have the chance to take any nice interior shots of the bar but the first thing that sticks out about the space is the great decor and feel they have created. Outdoor-but-indoors look with copious amounts of wood panels, wood table and bar countertops, fake plants, a ceiling lattice with vines and lights hanging off from above. Add some great music and a few nice vintage touches and you have a setting relaxed enough to simply have a nice drink and watch the game but upscale enough to make it an evening out before heading elsewhere along the Main. \\n\\nThe bar has a variety of beers on tap, some speciality cocktails and a pretty interesting \\\"Mickey\\\" service with different varieties of tequila, gin and bourbon. To start, I ordered an bourbon Olde Fashioned. For me personally, this is my test of a bar's (and a bartender's) worth. An olde fashioned is a very classic and straightforward drink but one that can be royally messed up if you don't take care to prepare properly. This one was okay. I've had better around the city but this is one I would order again to give it a second try.\\n\\nThe food menu is an interesting mix of warm and cold dishes that certainly are not what we would call \\\"traditional\\\" bar food. To start, a order of rosemary fries. Exactly what you would expect. Very crispy fries with a strong but not overbearing hint of rosemary. A good starter.\\n\\nNext up, my big winner for the evening : mini biscuit and fried chicken sandwiches with kimchi. A very unique but well created dish. The biscuit buns were solid, the fried chicken was nicely seasoned and crispy and the kimchi added a nice little kick with the festivities. Absolutely a must order again.\\n\\nTo change it out, we ordered the spicy Edamame. I love edamame and in the end, while it was quite good, let's just say that edamame covered with a spice mix is not necessarily the right thing to eat while sitting at a bar. A little too messy for my taste at a bar like this.\\n\\nStill hungry, we ordered the Meat Ball Tacos. While very creative, this was a miss for me mostly on account of the hard shell tacos being used. I was originally under the impression that it would be soft tortillas and I think it would have made it better and more importantly, easier to eat. When the shells crack after a bit and fall apart, it makes eating meat balls and smoked mozzarella covered in tomato sauce a little bit harder. I get the texture addition of the hard shells but it didn't do it for me.\\n\\nFinally, this bar even has dessert! we ordered the rice crispy Panini with chocolate, peanuts and homemade creme fraiche. Rich and sweet, this was a very nice way to finish a night of food with a few drinks.\\n\\nI did have some small issues with the service that evening - specifically the process of ordering food from the bar because the bartender who took our food order was also supposed to go pick up our order. At the same time, she got swamped with all the drink orders for all the tables so our food sat for pick up much longer than it should have. The staff seemed to fixed that issue by getting someone else to bring the food to the bar by the end of the night. It didn't have a negative impact on the food thankfully and I will be curious to see on my soon-to-be subsequent visits - and believe me, there will be. I live 10 minutes away on foot for god's sake! - if that was simply a opening week one-off.\\n\\nI was quite satisfied with my first taste of SuWu and happy to see a new neighborhood bar opened up close by. I will definitely be heading back to try the rest of the menu that still has me intrigued. Hopefully, they make a good enough impression with the rest of the locals to stick around for a while.\\n\\nCheers!"}

{"label": 0, "text": "WOW!!! Review pending. Go anywhere other then this 'Hospital'\\nMy husband and I decided that he needed to go to the ER to get assessed because he woke up in the morning with these large bumps on both of his legs just beneath his knees. His legs swollen, tender, and very red and hot to the touch. He began to develop raised bumps on his chest, back, and arms. It seemed to progress pretty quickly. My husband never complains about anything and absolutely avoids Dr's and would never dream of an ER visit unless he thought something was seriously wrong. I am a Registered Nurse and specialize in med/surg and after monitoring him throughout the day we decided to go down and be seen. I'm not positive but I thought it may be Erythema Nodosum, but I cannot diagnose of course, that would be up to the Dr. \\nHe checked in and was triaged very quick and then brought back to one of the beds. A male nurse came inland asked what was going on and we explained his signs and symptoms and gave a detailed report over the last 24 hours. The nurse was not paying attention at all while we talking. He did not do anything other then a quick glance and then exited the room. \\nNext the Dr came in and paid even less attention then  the nurse. Now the Dr just stood for a minute and she did not assess my husband or even slightly exam the affected areas. Now my husband had flu like symptoms over the last few weeks and had generalized fatigue. The Dr did not ask for any history, did not do an exam, and turned and left the room without saying one thing to us or even give us an opinion as to what it could be.\\nI never mention that I'm a nurse when I go to the Dr or clinc or wherever  as that could work against us.Wells a few minutes later the nurse came back in with discharge papers and an Rx for two antibiotics ( Keflex and Bactrim) as well as a oral prednisone.  No information, no exam, no review of history of other acute symptoms and he was handed his paperwork and said we could go. My husband was so mad because he was given no information and no medical advise at all. We asked the RN if we really were being released and the nurse said \\\"what would you like us to do\\\" Nice bedside manner you uncaring idiot. \\nWe left, husband very upset and \\\" we need your $125.00 co-pay\\\"\\nEven if it was something minor we should have at least been educated and given a rational for the antibiotics Now anyone in the medical field with direct patient care knows how important education is. Had we been just two people  with no medical back ground, we should have at least been informed on the importance of taking the antibiotics as prescribed, even when you are feeling better. Wow! Medication such as antibiotics have to be completed properly and many patients do not know this. So much for quality care and we will never use this \\\"hospital\\\" again. \\nAbsolutely horrible service and care. \\nHopes this helps even one person if they have a choice where to receive care."}

We rushed to the emergency room, why I have no idea, still waited 4 hours. But we wanted x-rays done to make sure that everything was still ok and there were no teeth broken off in there.\\nThey did the x-rays, which was a MASSIVE ordeal, the tech was very slow and taking his time and it took 30 min to get 3 pics because by the time he moseyed himself over to the button she was not in the EXACT position he wanted so we had to do it several times.\\nBut in the end the DR said that the teeth are completely gone and the gums and stuff are all good (sorry for the stuff, I cant remember the medical names), basically saying everything is good.\\nWe go home and after a couple days the blood clears and she is perfectly happy 1 year old playing with her big sister, but when she laughs we can see her gums and the gap, and guess what, we take her to a child dentist and yep, BOTH TEETH are still there! THE WHOLE TEETH, Idk who is looking at the x-rays, but they may need some glasses.\\n\\nSum Up\\nSo in short this place has done nothing but charge my insurance company and myself a ton of money to completely lie to us.\\nThe ONLY positive was the nurses, they were very nice.\\n\\nSo in my opinion only if your not going to make it to the next hospital, that should be the only time you stop here, even then I may take my chances."}
{"label": 0, "text": "In 2011, I arrived at the West Valley Hospital with a gunshot wound to my left leg. At the time I arrived at that hospital's Emergency Room, there were absolutely no other patients. I sat in one of their chairs with a large towel on my leg, wincing, for no less than thirty minutes after having signed in. While waiting, I noted that there were two nurses sitting at the front desk watching tv. Not to add an air of humor to this incident, but as we (myself and three acquaintances) waited in the ER \\\"lounge\\\" they attempted to commence having a conversation with me. As my ears were ringing quite badly (keeping in mind that this was a gunshot wound, and guns are by nature very loud), I replied by stating \\\"WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU! MY EARS ARE RINGING BECAUSE OF THE GUNSHOT!\\\" This elicited calls from one of the nurses to \\\"try to keep [my] voice down.\\\" Fifteen minutes after I arrived, signed in and indicated the nature of my injury, one of the nurses stood up and stated \\\"well, time for me to look like I'm doing something\\\", and walked away. Ten minutes after that, another nurse arrived at the front desk and was confronted by an acquaintance of mine who had accompanied me. when advised of the nature of my injury, the nurse asked two questions: the first being \\\"a WHAT?\\\", this quickly was followed not by \\\"is his blood pressure dropping?\\\" or \\\"does he have any secondary injuries?\\\" or anything of the sort, but by the question of \\\"DOES HE HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE\\\" which was answered in the negative due to unemployment. This received the response of \\\"WELL, THEN, HE'LL HAVE TO WAIT. WE HAVE OTHER PATIENTS WHO ARE INSURED.\\\" Fifteen minutes after that little jewel, I was finally ushered into one of the examination rooms. The secondary examination involved a nurse prodding the wound with her little finger, verbalizing the word \\\"eww\\\", and summoning the doctor who, in turn, told me that he was not about to try to stitch the gunshot hole closed as it \\\"would take too much of his time.\\\" Instead, I was given a trial sized packet of aspirin, a trial sized tube of Neosporin, two bandaids, and four pieces of three inch long by two inch wide gauze. Further treatment involved encouraging me to obtain a catheter tube, rinsing some warm water through it, and using it to flush remaining gun powder out of the wound to prevent infection. I later attempted to file for AHCCCS to cover the cost of the treatment, but was told by the hospital that they would \\\"encourage AHCCCS to decline the application.\\\" As this wound was due to the firing of a gun, the police were required by law to investigate the issue, which meant that they had to travel to the site where the gunshot occurred (they did) and interview myself and the three acquaintances which came with me to the hospital (they did this as well.) As a matter of fact, the interviewing of the witnesses and investigation at the scene was more time consuming than the \\\"treatment\\\" I received at the hospital. While the doctors and nurses were less than eager to treat me, the hospital's billing department could not wait to bill me for the expense of (again) two bandaids, 2 pieces of gauze, Neosporin and some aspirin) to the tune of $396.00. I have tried, on multiple (no less than five) occasions to speak with the patient advocate regarding this matter, but have been repeatedly ignored if not laughed at by hospital staff. The attitude of the staff at the West Valley Hospital is by far the most horrendous I have ever seen. Had this been a life-threatening injury wherein I had bled to death in the ER waiting room, there is no doubt in my mind that the personnel would throw a bill of charges at, and demand payment from, my corpse. At any rate, I have requested an audience with the patient advocate and anyone else at that hospital who would listen. Each time I have been (somewhat joyously, I might add) ping-ponged between agencies to the tune of \\\"we don't know the answer to that question, call this person at extension XXXX\\\"- This has been going on for three years. I have grown tired of the uncaring, disingenuous, and unprofessional manner in which the West Valley Hospital operates. I've seen better hospitals in so-called \\\"third-world\\\" countries."}
{"label": 4, "text": "I totally agree with \\\"Stephanie B\\\".  I've raised two kids and have been in plenty of urgent cares over the past 30 years but this one was, by far, the best.  The staff was incredibly friendly - front desk, nurses and physician.  My husband got treated incredibly fast (as did all the others that needed care).  There were four other people who needed to be seen and by the time my husband was done (only a 30 minute total visit time) everyone else had already been treated.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that if you're in the NE Phoenix/Scottsdale area and need an Urgent Care - definitely don't hesitate to go to this one."}

After waiting for over 5 minutes (there were only 2 people being helped in front of me), one of the girls totally skipped over us & helped the guy that just walked in. When the dude sitting on the couch smoking his vapor said to one of the girls that we were actually next, she finally helped us. We sampled a couple of flavors and when we asked for recommendations because the ones we sampled were watered down tasting, she said everyone's taste buds are different so you just gotta try them for yourself. Then when I asked her what's the sweetest flavor they got, she gave the same answer. Lame! She didn't even try to help us so we left & went to a local place called Up in Vapor instead to buy liquid. I know that Sin City Vapor II is way better, but I didn't want to drive that far. Next time, I'll either go back to Up in Vapor on Mountain Vista near my house or Sin City Vapor II. If you want crappy tasting liquid that's water down, want to wait & possibly be skipped over, and want no helpful service what so ever, go here.

{"label": 0, "text": "I've been to this shop 3 or 4 times. The first time I went I would have rated my experience a 2 or a 3, but the subsequent times I went there definitely a 1.\\n\\nThe problem was, that like most of their customers, I went here not knowing a thing about Vaping, and they have an internet presence that people, like me, find easily accessible and straight forward. People like me, who also want to get off cigarettes and/or dip have alot of skepticism and questions about vaping. I made it very clear that I will want to make a commitment to this instead of tobacco, so I wouldn't want to come back and spend money on batteries/tanks I didn't like. So what did they do? Sold me a starter kit.\\n\\nStupidly, I paid for it. I realize this works for some people, but I used to smoke a ton, especially at home. These little batteries not only didn't have any punch, but the little disposable tanks they push on you are good for perhaps one or two cycles, then they start to absorb flavors and everything starts tasting like garbage. \\n\\nI understand \\\"you get what you pay for\\\" with inferior product, but I made it VERY clear that I didn't want to come in and do the whole \\\"buy in increments\\\" until I finally found something that worked. I wanted a mod and a tank that was top notch, and I could enjoy. I guess they took my newbie-ness either not very seriously or thought i'd make a good target to shovel off some of their less desirable product. Either way, their reps didn't seem very concerned with my questions about the different tanks, what benefits variable voltage had, and pg/vg juice questions.\\n\\nTo top it all off, I noticed that these guys were free-pouring their juice. When asked how they can guarantee their consistancies with a free pouring like that, I was dismissed and assured they are well trained.\\n\\nSince then I have found many other shops that I prefer, I will never, ever, return here again."}

The veggies were crisp, the beef was well done but still  reasonably fresh - unlike at the typical Chinese - but the sauce tasted boring.

They do it right and have some twists to their Cantonese style cooking that we love.

The sauce is of the peanut variety and the won ton dough is \\\"slimy\\\" in texture, but they are DELICIOUOS. It is not on the menu so ask for it, in fact, if you are heading there, call ahead to insure that they will set aside an order or two for you.\\n\\nMy wife and I fought over the final one and ended up making a second order which we laughed through as we slurped them down.

Do wish that they would have a larger order and one with vegetables.  Will have to ask for the \\\"wor won ton\\\" type of soup.\\n\\nI find that the portions are fair, but not generous.  Rice is a measured bowl and the servings are OK for two people, but far short of what you get at other places.  You might find that where you order two mains you might want an appetizer or a third main.\\n\\nAnd don't expect spicy. Cantonese food is generally not spicy, so please ask if they will juice it up if you like more zip to their dishes.  Some dishes they will and others, no.  Chef's call.\\n\\nIt was no surprise to me when I found out that the chef of this family-owned restaurant is the former chef of Wan Fu in Charlotte.

It came in a big container cup as comparable to purplekow's cup out in SF - I love it, next time I will probably ask to make it a tad bit sweeter; but this is definitely one of my new favorite boba drinks in AZ! \\n\\nTo describe the tastes, it's a very light sweet cream milk slush with boba and grass jelly but I added pudding for an extra 39 cents and it's well worth it and added another level of sweetness :) \\n\\nThe other drinks I've got tonight was their Boba Milk Tea, Pina Colada Slush w/ popping boba,  and Berry Slush w/ popping boba!\\n\\nBoba Milk Tea, very subtle and not over powering - just about right in comparison to most other places.\\n\\nPina Colada Slush w/ mango & lychee popping boba, pretty good solid and easily recognizable universal taste and was perfect with my added toppings. \\n\\nBerry Slush w/ lychee popping boba, very good in terms of a berry slush - the strong tone of berry flavor would be a rasberry/blue berry flavoring and the lychee popping boba balanced it out for my tastes :)\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend boba lovers to try this place out for themselves if you're seeking something and some place new if you've frequent other boba shops; the yogurt I've sampled were very delicious and flavorful too!  i'm not really into yogurt but the banana cream pie was very very good!  I will definitely be coming back for the Ice Milk Slush!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "I can't comment on the teas or boba but the self serve yogurt tasted artificial and out of the box. There wasn't anything special about it is an easy way to put it. Three machines were out of order."}
{"label": 4, "text": "OMG!!!! House special: Ice milk, with boba, grass jelly and pudding! Where have you been all my life?! I just can't get over it. The boba, jelly & pudding complements the taste of the milk or vice versa. I love boba drinks! This place is the BEST-test that i've tried so far. The owner was really nice, sweet and was nice to talked to. A warm welcome, approachable & really good customer service. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and there it is, my boba waiting on my table. I wanna go back now!!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Came here solely for the iced milk boba with pudding (house special) because I heard it's comparable or similar to that of Half & Half's iced milk drink in Cali.   \\n\\nThis place only made me crave half&half more - it's not that great.  The drink took forever to make, and when I got it, I was sorely disappointed."}
{"label": 1, "text": "12/26/13 update:\\n\\nWell, they no longer serve several flavors of yogurt, highly disappointing.  They're going to switch it out for some shaved ice and the woman was quite rude to me this time around. I might just not make the extra three miles for some quality boba and stick with bomboba with their mediocre drinks."}
{"label": 3, "text": "This place has stepped up since I last had it when they first opened! The house special (milk tea with pudding, grass jelly, and boba) is delicious! I highly recommend it! I've had boba iced teas from others shops before who packs large amounts if ice into my drinks; however, Yo & I is very good with their ice to tea ratio. \\n\\nThe service wasn't great! The lady and her son are always very nice to us!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "First things first, the house special drink with iced milk slush, boba, pudding, and grass jelly is the only thing this place has to offer in my opinion. Other than that, service sucks and the other drinks are basic. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes for a drink with them being busy or not busy. This place has potential to be very popular, but it's just not there yet. I hope this place improves on their service and pace."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I was warned that this place was a little off. But did I listen? Nooo.\\n\\nIt looks a lot different than the pictures posted here. There are no more yogurt machines other than one behind the register, and the dispensers for various toppings are gone now. There are more tables and chairs. It seems like the focus has switched to the milk teas and smoothies.\\n\\nThe person running the register asked what I wanted four times. She looked like she was panicking on the inside from how busy the place was. I was a little annoyed at this point. Then I waited 20 minutes for two drinks; that is way too long of a wait.\\n\\nI give two stars because the almond milk tea is absolutely delicious, and my boyfriend seemed to enjoy the strawberry banana smoothie I brought home to him. Yo and I really needs to step up on the service though. Or maybe I shouldn't come here on the weekends."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Okay drinks. Bad service. They gave me drinks 25 minutes later and even gave someone (who ordered after me) their drinks before me. What the hell!? Just go to Bomboba for great service and great drinks :)! I love them there!"}
{"label": 3, "text": "Finally a better boba place in this area!!! I have tried the house special, coffee house special, almond milk tea, and taro slushie. \\n\\nI would only recommend the house special!! It is super yummy with boba, grass jelly, and pudding in a milky slush. The other drinks I tried were just okay in comparison.\\n\\nIf you're from CA, I think the house special is comparable to similar drinks we can get here. \\n\\nI like the location of this place. It can get crowded sometimes, but drinks come out quickly. They also have games! \\n\\nBath room is nice a clean too."}
{"label": 4, "text": "3rd or fourth time here they now have the flavored snow fluff. The owner Louise is always friendly and informative every time we come here. Enjoyed the variety of toppings they have especially for the new snow fluff. They now sell a variety of locally baked macaroons on the weekend. And occasionally the really hard to find green tea kit kats. Sometimes they run out of boba because they make fresh batches. If they run out try one of the puddings instead. It's still great in your smoothie."}
{"label": 4, "text": "This place is amazing. The snow tastes great, the Bob a is delicious not chappy like other spots...and the owner is friendly and fantastic. I walk in and she always remembers me and everyone that comes in."}
{"label": 4, "text": "I love this place, it's absolutely the best when it comes to their smoothies. I bring a lot of people to Yo & I and it never fails that they fall in love with the place as well. Whether you're getting boba in it or not, getting tea or just shaved snow, it'll taste great."}
{"label": 4, "text": "Got the house special drink and loved it!!!! Best boba drink hands down. Also tried the mango passion fruit & that was good too! Very nice lady!"}
{"label": 3, "text": "I like the strong tea flavor.. A lot of places you only taste the sweetness but not this! Yum"}
{"label": 4, "text": "Love this place. Friendly owners and the boba drinks are delicious! I used to live in Houston, TX where these types of drinks are popular and made well. Yo & I is as close as it gets in the Phoenix area!\\n\\nMy favorite items on the menu are:\\nJasmine Milk Tea\\nThe House Special\\nCoconut Smoothie\\n\\nThe boba is really fresh because they make it in small batches. The drinks are made fresh. And they all taste so yummy! I highly recommend this place."}
{"label": 4, "text": "I adore this place! It is a great find for boba and other special drinks and treats. The customer service is very good and helpful. The place has a nice, cute interior located in a friendly area. My favorites are the volcano green tea, the original iced milk tea with boba and the iced thai tea. If that isn't enough, try their shaved snow too. Good place to visit for a nice cold beverage on a hot summer day or just any day. I have been to many places that serve boba drinks in the valley and this is by far one of the best I have ever tasted. Give it a try, wont disappoint you."}
{"label": 4, "text": "I called around town and no one could give me final price. They advertise $99 any for room and then final price for house $300-500 . Mr champion was able give price out door w/ no surprise . I call on Friday and Sunday he was on time. After our walk through he got equipment ready and I left the house to pick up my kids while he work. It took about 3hrs for 1360sq house not bad. The carpet look brand new after 6 years living there."}
{"label": 3, "text": "Really good food and a great selection of beers! Usually really crowded but you have to expect that going to a baseball game!! Roman is the nicest and coolest guy there!!\\nWe really had a great time!!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Was excited to try the new menu at \\\"Game 7\\\".  4 of us got there at 11:15 for a 1:05 game on a Sunday.....  Restaurant was definately NOT full.  A hostess sat us and did not leave menu's. The manager/general manager (short haired guy running around with NO customer service skills) almost threw us out because we were sitting without menus in front of us and thought we \\\"snuck\\\" in.  I pointed to the front hostess stand and explained he should be talking to the hostess instead of making my group feel like criminals for sitting there. We were hungry otherwise that would of been the end of that.\\n     The  tables that were available were outside... We started with a table in the shade, but after a 1:45 minute meal we were in DIRECT sunlight. by the end....Umbrellas would have been a nice touch...especially in AZ. \\n    The people at the BENCH next to us had an issue with the red bench paint transferring to their clothes.  This same manager explained that he does not MAKE the benches, he runs a restaurant.  Our table, their table and other tables in earshot could not believe the explanation he was giving them. To his credit he discounted their bill, but definitely made an uncomfortable situation worse.......AGAIN\\n   All business' have problems.  It is how a business HANDLES the problems.  This manager , face of the business, better have his days numbered as the food was not bad. \\n    There will always be one extra table available IF you go to this place as I will not be back...Thank the management for that......"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Decided to try this place after looking at the menu online and watching the clip about it during a Dbacks game onTV.  Will not go back!\\n\\nFIrst off, there is little seating unless you have a RESERVATION!  Many available tables to the left of the entrance for reservations, but for folks without a reservation tables were to the right side.  Our choices were inside where there was a bar and about 15 tables (all full) , or outside where there were about 5 tables and some red picnic tables lined up.  \\n\\nThe picnic tables were so close together some were difficult to get between and were filthy!  Plus, the red seemed to rub off on clothes and shoes.\\n\\nNow we could deal with all that seeing as the place is right outside the stadium.  So we found a table and tried to order food.  We had to ask around to find how to do that- then be self-sufficient in the process!  We had to go to the hostess station for a menu, and then go inside to the bar to order and pay.  They did ask where we were sitting, brought it out when it was done and waiters appeared once the order was up to bring the food and condiments.  Food was just OK- \\n\\nThe real kicker for us was that the prices on the menu for food and beer were not what  we were charged.  Our hamburger was listed at 10.95 but we were charged 11.95- not a huge difference but still annoying.\\n\\nThe real difference came in the beer.  Beers listed on the menu as $5-$6 were actually $7-$8 when you got them!  Again not a big deal seeing as we were so close to the stadium, but still annoying.  Why print a menu price if it's not correct???\\n\\nIf the tables had been clean, the place more organized, and the menu pricing reflecting the actual prices- the whole experience would have been different for us.  \\nThe place is convenient if you are meeting someone before a game, but I can honestly say we will not be returning!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "This place has horrible food. I am sorry. It really isn't that good. Nothing we sampled was worth writing about, the pulled pork was dry, the loaded potato skins were wet (oily) and the pretzel cheese was tasty but so runny it wouldn't stay on the pretzels - which weren't that good themselves.\\n\\nThe three stars are for the following:\\n\\nLive Music - the Stage is perfect, and the location is so fun, and the band they had (The Hamptons Band) was excellent.  It was so fun outside and everyone was dancing and clapping and drinking (and trying to smoke...but getting busted! LOL! No smoking on the patio on either side!)\\n\\nStephanies - Both of them are amazing and they both worked really hard to help us all day.  They are a great team.  The service and management there is really quite good. They were running out of everything in sight (ketchup, soda, ice, etc.) and they worked hard to please.  I was there for a while, so I saw how hard they worked!\\n\\nThe Apple Pie Dessert Thing - Too good...so good! Like a big chewy turnover with apples and chewy yummy crust! Vanilla bean ice cream with caramel drizzled over it. YUMMMY\\n\\nIt's hard to avoid this place if you like baseball, so go after the game for a drink and yummy apple stuff.  And, hopefully there will be fun music! :-)"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Pros: Right next to Chase, they have beer.\\n\\nCons: Atmosphere is super lame, not as hip as Slider's was. It's more like going to a Chili's rather than a cool sports bar, hard to get pumped for the game there. The beer selection is limited, that's fine I usually drink domestics at sporting events. Wont find a IPA or a STOUT here though.  Staff is friendly but lacking enthusiasm. The old school Slider's Shot Girls and Beer Girls were much quicker and easier to order from (no waiting for you drink to arrive). Live music is okay but might be better post-game. The crowd seems to respond better to newer music to get pumped/ excited.  Food is fine, I had the nachoes there once, a lil' over priced but that's cause of the location. I save my money for $1.50 dogs inside Chase.\\n\\nmy summary: I would give GAME 7 one star but the fact that it's close to the Field and they serve beer is the only thing saving them. BRING BACK SLIDER'S"}
{"label": 1, "text": "Extremely disappointed with the new game 7 apparently the owners wanted a more family themed bar/restaurant which I can understand for pregame and change to menu looks good although I did not get any food. The fun ways of the old beer girls outside with a big crowd of fun is over no drink specials except for Sunday day games supposedly and drinks after the game forget about it since they close at 11 lame but they're loss in revenue, went to Coaches Corner right across the street from game 7 for after game fun and great drink specials. Bring back Sliders I always went there before and after games will not return."}
{"label": 0, "text": "I noticed that there were a few positive reviews towards the end.They must be paid shills. This place is now so different than before with the rules of \\\"you can't sit here and just order drinks outside in the hot sun unless you have a food order\\\"\\nAnd then they have all these military style thugs breathing down your neck all the time. They must have a lot of people leave without paying.I never ordered from this despicable crappy place because I hate the atmosphere. Very few people go in there anymore because it is so Nazi."}
{"label": 0, "text": "Staff is horrible. Got an eye roll from the bartender when I ordered iced tea. Actually, it was more of a snarl. Got a highball glass full of ice with about 3 ounces of tea. We got moved from a corner where we weren't in anyone's way to a through way where tons of people needed to get by. 1st and last time I go in there!"}
{"label": 0, "text": "I go here often because it's a convenient spot to meet up before the game, but after they treated my friends and I so rudely this past weekend I'll never bother again. We grabbed a beer at the bar in the back because it was less crowded and we were standing in a corner and in front of the stairs that were blocked off from public access anyway but we got yelled at (and I literally mean yelled at) to move because that area wasn't for standing room. (Like I said, I go often and we actually always stand on that side of the bar and it's always pretty crowded so I don't even think that's a rule.) So, we moved to the other bar and another guy came over and yelled at us AGAIN! Apparently we were still in the way. We actually tried to ask him where standing room was but he interrupted us and said either get out of the way and go outside. He was treating a group of 30ish year olds who were half a beer in like we were rowdy college kids causing a scene! It was really obnoxious. I don't think I can bring myself to give money when they treated us like they didn't even want us there."}
{"label": 3, "text": "Nice little bar next to the baseball stadium in Phoenix. I stopped in here to have a beer before the game and was seated immediately. It got pretty busy and noisy inside and some people were standing right behind me talking quite loudly. Otherwise, service was fast and speedy despite the crowd. Got a nice cider in a glass for $5 and savored it down."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Don't usually go to the bars around the ballpark.  I have never been impressed with the food or prices. \\n\\nBut we found ourselves at the ballpark early last weekend. And decided to go in at least to get out of the heat. \\n\\nI found they have a nice selection of beers on tap including a favorite Cider that I enjoy.  They also had a nice selection of appetizers.  Theme of the menu revolved around pulled pork items along with the normal burgers and sandwiches. \\n\\nWe had the potato skins with pulled pork and a couple of drinks.  Was very pleased as it started the day off. \\n\\nWill consider this location again for full meal alternatives before game time!!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "I love a well placed, fun sports bar to go to before the game that day. When its well run, there is nothing better. When its poorly managed, it has \\\"Meh\\\" written all over it. Lets turn double play and discuss Game Seven:\\n\\n~Fud/Drink~\\nI must admit, I did not try food when I went. Reason being, it was pretty expensive, and I had already stretched the ol' budget for the tickets I got. I saw some people's items, and yes it does beat what you get in the stadium, but just by a little. Quality is that of a normal sports bar. I have seen much better. As for drinks, wow, so priced up. I get it, I do. They have to to make ends meet. But seriously, $6.50 for a pint? Plus, its just general across the board, so from Stella to Budweiser....its $6.50. It once again beats inside, but why bother? There is a place right down the corner that is about half this price.....hmm I wonder where...read on...\\n\\n~Atmosphere/Service~\\nJust like the old Sliders here, nothing much has changed. Its a nice wide open space with two levels to choose from. The outdoor patio is inviting, even in hot weather there are misters and a good amount of room to bring a group of friends. There is not much ambiance to the place, the bar area itself is wide open with a couple TV's and long bar. Not an abundance of flare or items on walls. As for service, I can only attest to the barkeeps. They were very attentive, although I went very early to the game and was one of the few there...it wasn't hard to serve me. Each of the individuals I worked with were talkative and fun, and were prompt when I asked to close out.\\n\\n\\nExtras/Rating~\\nTwo stars are provided for location to ballpark and friendly service. I truly feel that this is place is a trap for out-of-towners. They  come to see their team and did not check it out in advance or ask the motel/hotel where to go pre-game. I went for the Orioles series, and at the first game, there was a sea of orange here. The next game, they all realized to go to another location...I did as well. For better deals, including HAPPY HOUR PRICES, go to Coach's Corner, just a stone's throw away on Jefferson. Prices for food and drinks are much cheaper, along with comparable service. I rarely shout out another business on a review, but seriously, do not waste your money for beer, it makes no sense. I see redeeming factors if you have a super large group of friends wanting a quick beer or two before/after the game. Besides that, skip Game Seven Grill and choose from a ton of other bars in the area."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Came here during Dbacks Fan Fest not just for the DBacks Alumni Players signing that was happening on the restaurant's corridor, but also to visit friends who were there and grab a bite to eat during a break int he action of Fan Fest. Well, come to find out they closed the kitchen so I wasn't able to get anything to eat. I was majorly disappointed...that's a BIG fail in my book! \\n\\nLooking over their menu ahead of time, about the only reasonably priced item I saw was their salad, I believe a grilled chicken one if I recall...the rest of the items were rather pricey, and from seeing what friends of mine have ordered in the past, they definitely give you your money's worth and then some, but yeah, I wouldn't make this place an everyday stop for food.\\n\\nI would like to be able to TRY it sometime,, however, so I can give it a \\\"second chance\\\" and see if my star ratings will go up or not."}
{"label": 0, "text": "No. Just...no.\\nJoke of a menu, bad food, bad service, bad atmosphere, overpriced. \\n\\nMy husband and I came here for dinner and a beer before the game, and it was the worst. The service was timely enough, but the server couldn't answer any of our questions. I asked if the Schreiner's sausage was served whole, like a hot dog, or shaved on a hamburger bun. \\\"I'm not sure, sorry.\\\" Okay.... We also asked if they had XX Lager or amber, and she said amber. I thought it was weird because the lager is so common, but dismissed it...until I saw someone walk away from the bar with a lager. Then, when she came back to take our order, the busser walked by and she flat out interrupted my husband in order to tell the busser something, to which he replied that the lady at another table needed a refill. It was...awkward. Especially because the restaurant wasn't even busy! In keeping with the theme, our server came and dropped the check, picked it up, and brought it back without ever speaking a word to us. \\n\\nSo, anyway, I got nachos ($12?!). The chicken that came on them was like rubber, and in huge long pieces that needed to be cut to fit into a bite. Nachos are not a fork and knife friendly food. The cheese sauce was gross and the chips were hard, and the sour cream was a laughable little squeeze. My husband got the 3 pulled pork sliders ($10), which came without sauce which is weird, and on dry bland buns. The fries were okay. We left well over half our food untouched. It's a disappointing way to waste $40, especially when there are so many great places close by.\\n\\nI would only suggest coming here for a drink before the game if everywhere else is packed and you MUST be right by the gates."}
