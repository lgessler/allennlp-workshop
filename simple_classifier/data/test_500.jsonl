It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers.

My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers.

{"label": 3, "text": "My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \\n\\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \\\"Rubber Ducky\\\" and \\\"Gangsta's Paradise\\\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \\\"anything else,\\\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \\\"yinz\\\" instead of \\\"you.\\\"\\n\\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \\\"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\\\" he said when she requested him.\\n\\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\\n\\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\\n\\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\\u00e4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list."}

They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun.

I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \\n\\nWas it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks.

Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.  \\n\\nMy husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.  \\n\\nWhen the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \\\"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\\\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \\\"drizzling\\\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.\\n\\nWhat we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.  \\n\\nThe \\\"numero uno\\\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.  \\n\\nThe ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.  \\n\\nAnd lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?

{"label": 1, "text": "REDO!\\n\\nI went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  \\n\\nMy issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  \\n\\nMy resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.\\n\\nSo we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:\\n\\nCoca Cola\\nIced Tea\\nPan fried pork dumplings\\nSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soup\\nChangs chicken with white rice\\n\\nOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times, but at no point could I get her to come back to my table.  I tried the soup and was disgusted with it and placed it at the end of the table.  I didn't know what it was and didn't want to know.  Almost ten minutes later she arrived quite happy with the job she was doing and asked how the food was.  I asked if she could bring out some egg drop soup. I didn't expect to get the stink-eye.\\n\\nMy egg drop soup was brought out with the dumplings as well as the caddy of different sauces and oils.  The server really wasn't that into the experience, but again gave me the stink-eye when I told her that mixing the sauces was unnecessary since I knew what each of them was and would be able to mix them myself.  I mixed the rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, and soy sauce (my guess is that it was supposed to be tamari) to create a dipping sauce for our dumplings. I took a bite of the soup and it was somewhat better than the other soup, but it was still brown.  I ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server.  It was thick and gooey and the flavor didn't wow.  I saw no reason to continue.  I moved on to the dumplings, which had an okay flavor to them.  The skins were a bit thick and doughy.  The meat on the inside did not balance this attribute at all.  The sauce tasted a little odd so I tried to remix and it was still off.  I tried the components individually and found that some of them were either old, stale, or rancid.  We finished our dumplings.\\n\\nOur lunch entrees arrived.  I had ordered mine extra-spicy, but I guess it came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) and had a lackluster flavor at best.  The meat was tough and the sauce tasted of soy sauce more than anything else.  I tried some of Chang's chicken and was equally mollified.  This was supposed to be their version of General Tso's Chicken.  Now I have never had a General's chicken that was the same at any place.  It is always different.  Many of them are good in different ways.  This food, though, it wasn't good.  Chang's chicken fell into the same category as the Sesame Chicken -- since it tasted mainly of soy sauce -- with the addition sugar.  \\n\\nI just don't understand how anyone can like this place.  Even the Yoshida Sauce you get at Sam's/Costco tastes better."}

I waited thinking she was printing a receipt - nope! Eventually - after whipping out her phone and sending a text or two - she realized I was still there and told me to go to the next window for my food. Whatever, I figured, forget the receipt; by then I was pretty sure she had moved on to other orders and couldn't print my receipt anyway. On to the next window, where I was given my food and drink...and I proceeded to quickly discover they gave me no straw and for some reason, layered my Big Mac as such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, how does one even mess that up? I give one brownie point because the fries really were actually pretty good...but they were not worth the wait or trouble.\\n\\nI concur with the other reviewers: skip this place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else is better and less of a waste of your time and money, and the people here are so slow that you'll spend more time waiting for your food then you will eating it."}

This was our \\\"go-to\\\" restaurant.\\n\\nAFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.\\n\\nOn our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.\\n\\nThe food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe."}

Right!

My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. \\n\\nThe \\\"stylist\\\" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in? Nope! She called him over and I said \\\"sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line\\\" and the lady said \\\"oh we don't do that.\\\" WTF?? You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this? So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. \\n\\nAnd waited, and waited, while one \\\"stylist\\\" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been \\\"on break,\\\" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \\\"after I'm done here,\\\" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS!

Very classy, wish I could remember her name. Young girl with dirty blond hair. \\n\\nThe food was pretty blah in my opinion. Bar food none too exceptional. We had nachos that were on slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone had a burger or sandwich. As I glanced over to my friends Pulled pork it looked dry and sad left sitting on the plate. She said it was \\\"EH\\\". I ordered a Gobbler Club sandwich. It was humongous but not that tasty, pretty dry. How can you go wrong with a club but the thick cuts of turkey did not sit well with me and I didn't like it at all. Bad texture.

I bear the friendly people of Pizza Parma no ill will.\\n\\nBut their pizza was remarkably terrible.\\n\\nWent there, hungry, a bit past midnight, looking for a little something before going home to sleep. They don't have slices--this seems to be a (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend in these parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, a \\\"personal\\\" pie, costs $7 and is 7\\\" in diameter. The cashier and I agree that that's a very small amount of pizza, and since I'm hungrier than one and one half mouthsful, I get a \\\"small,\\\" which is 10\\\". I add a mushroom topping. I pay my $11.21 and wait.\\n\\nThere are two seating options inside the store: a small wooden bench, and two fold up chairs around a little table. Conveniently, they were using the wooden bench to store a rolled up carpet that laid across the whole thing, and they'd also elected to fold up the two folding chairs, probably because they were tired from a long day of being used as chairs. So I waited outside the store on a bench.\\n\\nThe friendly cashier and the friendly patrons waiting for their order indoors called me over when my pizza was ready. I took it outside, sitting in the cold to eat it, thinking, \\\"I hope this $11 pizza is pretty good.\\\" Opened up the box, saw how pitifully small a 10\\\" pizza is, and started eating.\\n\\nLet me say something about pizza: if you have decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, and a hot oven, you can make a passable pizza. I will eat it and think, \\\"well this isn't the best pizza I've ever had but it's fine.\\\" That is not what I thought when I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, \\\"it would be too rude and insulting to ask for my money back. I'll just try to eat as much of this as I can.\\\"\\n\\nI ate three out of the six \\\"slices.\\\" (One sixth of a 10\\\" pizza is a total of *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like a lot of pizza, but in fact is a tiny amount of pizza.) I couldn't stand to eat more than half. The mushrooms were fine; I fished them out and ate them. The cheese was actually terrible; it had a strange chemical taste and plasticky appearance. The crust was poofy and not crusty.\\n\\nAshamedly, I threw half of a pizza away tonight. Folks, I am not a food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, and expired foods, because I don't want to waste. It takes a legitimately terrible pizza for me to actually throw the thing away.\\n\\nWent home, made some eggs, and guess what? The terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago?

Worst part about the basement is the thumping from the sub-woofer located above -- really ridiculous. Service was fine. Timing of drinks and first brunch course were acceptable given it was a busy day, but then gap of 35+ minutes for entrees left us all sitting there, not enjoying the dark of the basement nore the perpetually thumping base.

It had a great sandwich (crab) and the soup was pretty decent (cream of cauliflower). Not sure how they are owned by the same people as Soba (I mean, obviously different chefs) but usually the same owner means similar quality and price, no?  Maybe the dishes are just hit and miss, and I got a hit here, whereas I had a serious miss over at Soba.  In any case, the crab sandwich was good-- nice, large chunks of crab.  No overkill on the sauce.  The soup was likewise good.  I don't understand how the two restaurants could possibly be related given the night and day of my food experience!  The wine, however, was overpriced for the quality.  I guess people aren't from SF and expect good wines for the same price!

We went during happy hour last week and I had the worst tasting rye drink possible - described as rye with fig jam, bitters and lemon, sounded like something that cannot possibly be fucked up, but tasted like nothing but the juice wrenched out of unripe lemons - super dry and gave me a stomach ache. No fig flavor to be detected. To make matters worse, when my partner tried to ask the bartender about the drink, if it was supposed to be sooo god-aweful lemony, she responded with a \\\"yes, it's got lemon in it.\\\" When he pressed the issue, she simply repeated, \\\"yes, it's a lemon and fig drink.\\\" More frustrating than conversations with the wall. The risotto that we ordered was the size one would expect of a side dish (which is what risotto should be, but this was proposed as an entree...). It had about 5 little pieces of maitake mushroom and 6 hazelnuts in it and was otherwise flavorless. We added lots of salt and pepper. Total waste of $25 bucks. \\n\\nAlso, their bar seating sucks.

Definitely ask for cheddar with your grits if you eat dairy.  The three kinds of hot sauce on the table also help perk things up.\\n\\nNo complaints about the service, but they use some sort of chemical cleaner (for the floors or to wipe down the tables, maybe?) that's unpleasant-smelling.  I noticed it less the longer we stayed, maybe because I got food in front of me, but one would hope that a vegetarian establishment might opt for more environmentally friendly and less noxious cleaners.  Other diners were also commenting on the smell when we were there.  I'm guessing this isn't a regular smell to the place, though, since no other reviewers have commented on it.  \\n\\nThe cash-only policy is also a bit of a nuisance, since I'd consider the prices ($11 for brunch entrees) here to be mid-range and not ultra-cheap.

After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that.

Right when I walked in I saw an array of freshly prepared vegetables that were on a table in the kitchen area. It was beautiful and really made realize right then what kind of place this was. The service we had was second to none. Right from entering we were promptly seated and received an explanation of everything that was on the table for our enjoyment. The \\\"Holy Oil\\\" was ridiculous and almost addicting I couldn't stop drowning the fresh bread in that stuff that I think I ruined my appetite.  Folks when you come here don't eat lunch because the food dishes are huge. We ordered an appetizer of Mussels Diavolo which had a huge amount of decent mussels in a spicier tomato sauce. The sauce was really spicy and flavorful that I couldn't waste it so I asked for more bread and took care of that. I think I should have come here with more people because already it was too much and too good just for two people. \\n\\nThen be prepared after your salad there is a pasta course, which I probably could have done without because I was approaching topped off. The pasta was in a vodka sauce that I could have been happy with for my main dinner.\\n\\nI then ordered the Filet Mignon, which was hands down the best piece of meat I have ever had in my life to date. They cooked it to my request of medium spot on,and the chunk of filet was so large that I can't figure out how they cooked it so perfectly. Than it was covered in a red wine sauce with mushrooms that was savory to say the least. We both had to take most of our entrees home with us which was unfortunate because they were so awesome. Matter of fact I'm eating the side of bacon mashed potatoes this morning as I write this review.\\n\\nI did think that it might be hard to come here if you don't eat meat because the menu on this Friday night was meat-tastic. They probably could make a pasta dish without might to suit ones requests but I don't know for sure. Also I did think that the menu online was a little misleading as I thought that there would have been more pasta options on the particular night I was there. There was only one option when I was there and it had a sauce that contained two meats sausage and pork.\\n\\nI wish my bank account could handle more of this place, I will be back once I roll my wallet out of the ER. If anybody has any suggestions on how I can do this place more often please let me know!"}

They have a very good beer selection and even though the kitchen is a 4 foot by 4 foot square behind the bar the food is really good. \\n\\nThey have all you can eat Popcorn and Peanuts so you will never be in want of something to snack on while drinking your favorite beer. \\n\\nThey have live bands several times a week my favorite being Tuesdays which often features local Blue Grass musicians.  \\n\\nThe down side to this place for me is that it's a little on the expensive side. They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5  but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often. I just wish all their beers were under $5 because I would probably try and go here more often.  \\n\\nOver all it's a great bar the owner is a nice guy and you're going to have a great time."}

{"label": 4, "text": "I had a week off from work recently.  I needed it to take a little break and I decided, what better way to get caught up on all the museums and cultural institutions in the 'Burgh?\\n\\nTo say that the Carnegie is THE Pittsburgh Cultural Institution is indeed an understatement and as I live in nearby Squirrel Hill, I am so happy to have it within walking distance.  Although the day I visited, I rode my bike and parked it all day.  (Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).\\n\\nI decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, \\\"stuffed and mounted\\\" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\\n\\nA long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\\n\\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  \\n\\nOne special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is \\\"Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs\\\".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  \\n\\nSo while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything."}

How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed.

{"label": 2, "text": "A brick wood-fired smoker with a cast iron door, a stainless steel prep table with cutting boards, cooler case, a cash register, and a man who has been tending the coals well beyond your time.\\n\\nWilson's is what a great BBQ place should be.  Simple. \\n\\nThere is no sense in overanalyzing what Mr. Wilson has been doing here for years.  He's not a competition circuit smoker, not a modern restaurateur spreading his seed across Pittsburgh, and certainly no hipster chef serving ingredients grown in his rooftop garden.\\n\\nRibs. Chicken. Sauce.\\n\\nThe slow smoked spare ribs, sold by the plate size or full rack, are smoked just long enough to make the rib bones protrude from the top of the slab but not long enough so the meat is \\\"falling off the bone\\\"... tender and juicy, but enough bite to let you know that you're eating the flesh off an animal.  The color and texture of the surface aren't overwhelming in flavor but give you just enough crust and seasoning to let you experience the strata of bark / meat / fat.  For those that don't like fat, you'll complain about the ribs.  Spares have a tendency to hold a bit more fat within the meat fibers, particularly the section around the tips that are usually trimmed for a St. Louis cut.  you want low fat? Eat a pork loin or a handful of grass.\\n\\nThe chickens are halved and smoked right alongside the ribs. The skin had nice chew, a good simple rub, and cooked beyond the point of any gummy texture but not so long that it was a layer of armor surrounding the meat.  The dark meat was succulent and the white meat maintained just the right amount of moisture.\\n\\nAs requested, everything was served with the hot BBQ sauce.  Not mind blowingly hot, but a well rounded picquant flavor with a bit of black pepper on the tip of the tongue.  Tomato base with a bit of vinegar, good enough to compliment the meat and fat of both animals.\\n\\nAs for sides, the collard greens are tender and you'll come across the occasional gold nugget of pork.  The coleslaw and macaroni salad are simple and a bit underseasoned, but when eaten in tandem with the meat and sauce they compliment everything just fine.  Mr. Wilson also caps off an order with the true stamp of great bbq... white bread. A vessel to mop up all the rib shrapnel swimming in the pool of sauce at the bottom of your styrofoam container.\\n\\nIt's not the cleanest, it's not the classiest... why?  It's a rib shack in an old house that's been here for going on 53 years.  It may not be the best barbecue you'll ever eat, but in a city with new restaurants popping up every week that all try to outduel each other with trendy ingredients, it's nice to know that I can walk in through an old screen door and be slapped in the face with a stiff breeze of smoking pork... without having to worry about anyone selling me small portion size, extravagant presentation, and a list of 35 ingredients to compose a single dish."}

Or she could have talked to someone in the first place and quietly resolved the matter without us even knowing there was a problem to begin with.

Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.

Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!\\n\\nBTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.\\n\\nAdded note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there."}

The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.\\n\\nStaff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.\\n\\nOver all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.  I would rather get a sandwich that is half the size with more flavor, then a huge pile of bland food."}
{"label": 2, "text": "This is a neither a yay or nay place for me.  Understanding the underlying concept of the sandwiches from way back when, can make a person appreciate Primanti's for what they are.\\n\\nI ordered the pastrami served on two thick slices of bread, layered with french fries and cole slaw.  Granted, I like my carbs, but this was overload for me.  I wasn't particularly fond of the cole slaw either.  \\n\\nI think this is more of an acquired taste kind of place.  Not that I wouldn't go back, it's okay for an occasional visit.  There are other sandwiches to try.  But if you're used to the true pastrami with Swiss on rye, I wouldn't recommend the sandwich here.\\n\\nThe place itself is small and good for a group of four.  Eight if you don't mind sitting at two separate tables that are relatively close to each other."}

But stay strong, and look them down until they take your order. PS make sure you get sauce in those little packets.  Sammich is at best 6/10 but is comes with fries on the sandwich, fries!!

The food was great as I was told from several people from the area and back home.\\n\\nWhat I was not happy with was the setting policy and service. Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card. It took so long and with other people looking at us to get the hell up so they could sit we just walked in to retrieve the card at was just sitting on the back of the bar and had not yet been processed so I had to wait again.\\n\\nFood can only get you so far, so my suggestion is if you want a good Food and can wait an hour feel free and come here. If you don't have the time just go next door to the Subway."}

As others have mentioned, the signature toppings of cole slaw (which I normally loathe, but, in this case, loved!), french fries and cheese accompany any of your \\\"meat\\\" choices for a sandwich.  The menu is limited, and there are no frills or false pretenses here.  I would definitely eat here again!  I had the fish and cheese sandwich, and it was outstanding!  I can't give the place 5 stars, because it didn't completely wow me, and the others in my party were a little disappointed.

I am usually tuned off by corn tortillas, but theirs are soft, not dry, and don't fall apart as the taco juices seep in. In other words exactly what you need for a good street taco.

We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for $14.99. Ok, we were game.\\n\\nWe've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight! \\n\\nThat couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule? \\n\\nThe upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar.

Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.\\n\\nMy recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \\\"guys night out.\\\"  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.

I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.

'twas a savory and delicious experience.\\n\\nThey have a great hot coffee selection (4 delicious flavors, 1 being decaf). I mixed the vanilla hazelnut with the dark roast and added all of their spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla & cocoa) and a splash of milk (they have skim, 2% & half-and-half). For a small bottomless cup, it was only $1.79 plus tax!  I got the bagel free because I joined their rewards club.  Perfect way to start my day!! You shall not be disappointed by their broad selection of wonderful treats & such.  I would love to try their lunch bagel sandwiches!"}
{"label": 2, "text": "I hate being the person that brings bad news to a business.  But I would rather Yelp about it and people know rather than it goes unnoticed.  More on that later in the review. \\n\\nI booked this stay about two months prior to me showing up on New Year's Eve.  Check it went fairly smooth with a little bump.  I forgot one of my IDs in my car and could not be checked in until after I had that ID in hand.  After walking back to my car I returned and everything went smoothly afterwards.  Kudos to the front desk staff for allowing me to leave my bag there instead of having to drag it back to my car and back to the hotel.\\n\\nThe room itself gave the impression that it was huge.  As several people have already stated, the ceiling were very high.  I was lucky enough to have a front facing room that looked out over Penn Ave.  I kind of loved this as I could watch the New Year's Eve parade from my room and save myself from the freezing temps outside.  However, you could tell that this was an older building as the floors creaked as I walked around the room.  I could also hear the person above as they walked about.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean.  I am not sure how this happened, but I got a handicap room.  So I am assuming that this is why everything felt so spacious in here as well.  Everything about the room screamed modern, from the paint colors to the carpeting.  \\n\\nNow, to get back to what I was referring to at the beginning; the bad news.  Upon arriving at the hotel and after checking in I decided I needed to take a nap in preparations for the night's festivities.  It was a fairly short nap, roughly about an hour.  When I woke up after my nap and turned on the light, I noticed something crawling across the sheets.  *starts itching*  Yes people, it was what you are thinking, a bedbug.  BEDBUG!  I immediately grabbed a tissue to dispose of the hideous little monster (I know, it did me no good by doing that, it was more of a reflexive response than anything).  I have made contact with Courtyard about this, but have yet to hear back from them on how they are going to rectify the problem.  I felt dirty afterward and moved all of my belongings into the bathroom, on the counter for the remainder of my stay.  I also slept in the other bed (I know, that may have been futile) and with the lights on for the rest of my stay.\\n\\nOther than that snag, I really have no complaints about this place.  Everything and everyone was pleasant.\\n\\n*Things to note: there is room service available, valet service, or if you prefer, park in one of the city garages and walk to the hotel, business center, fitness center, ATM and Starbucks available around the clock at the front desk."}

It's worth the trip in and of itself. \\n\\nThe only downer about this location are the hours. They close at 8:00 or something. And only open on Sunday if there's a Steeler/Pirate game in town that day. I can't tell you how many people I've seen try and dine here when they're closed. Also, they're always understaffed. It's turned into somewhat of a running joke with us: the staff expect to be slow but they get slammed every night we're there! So the servers end up with 10 tables or so. And there's never a hostess to seat guests, so people just end up wandering in and seating anywhere. This adds to the chaos. It's almost painful to watch. But the staff is very friendly, for the most part. Only once have I been upset at service and it was with a to-go order. The bartender took my order and didn't write anything down. I knew it was a bad sign but didn't say anything. Sure enough, the whole order was f'd up. We called and complained and they comped us a meal.

I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\\n\\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\\n\\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\\n\\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\\n\\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\\n\\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal."}

{"label": 2, "text": "For years, when going to the theater, my friend and I have eaten across the street at Indian Spices, or occasionally next door at Christo's, looking out one window and into the window of Lemon Grass.  They never looked especially busy (but then during theater times, I've rarely been anywhere downtown that really WAS 'especially busy') and we really didn't know anything about it.  So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.\\n\\nI see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.\\n\\nI'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.\\n\\nLemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.\\n\\nThe menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.\\n\\nThe appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.\\n\\nAnyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.\\n\\nMy friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.\\n\\nFor the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.\\n\\nMy friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.\\n\\nAfter the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.\\n\\nThe dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.\\n\\nThe dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.\\n\\nThe bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.\\n\\nWe both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.\\n\\nThe staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.\\n\\nFor the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.

{"label": 1, "text": "D'Amico's is like...Olive Garden, only less festive and with more \\\"local color.\\\"  We came here for a coworker holiday dinner at 530 pm on a Thursday.  We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\\n\\nOur server was definitely \\\"set in her ways,\\\" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \\\"does not compute\\\" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \\\"...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\\\" and I was all \\\"yes, I just got here....I don't even know what I want!\\\" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \\\"oh, do you need a list or something?\\\"  I know, I'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I'm weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\\n\\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\\n\\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn't think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  It's just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \\\"meh\\\" the food was, I think it's way overpriced.\\n\\nSo I wouldn't go back.  It's not my kind of food, or place.  For all the Italian folks around here, I'm sure Pittsburgh must have way better Italian food offerings than this."}

I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.

The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner.

She forgot to put our order for a basket of bacon in and we had to ask for it thirty five mins later. Bacon doesn't take that long to cook. Then, we had to ask for ranch with our wings - which we'd already requested, but she'd brought us bleu cheese instead. Oh, AND they were out of bacon wings! On bacon night! WTF. \\n\\nAnyways, we also had to request sour cream for the pierogies, which is normally brought out with them, plates (b/c we were sharing several appetizers), and ketchup. Why ketchup? Let me tell you. We'd ordered the sliders as well, and it was the saddest display of baby burgers I've ever seen. \\n\\nThey were brought out on one of the same small plates that we had for sharing our apps - like the size of a saucer that you'd put a tea cup on. And there were only TWO of them. Two! For six bucks I'll go get six non-mini burgers at freaking mcdonalds. And to top it off, they were dry as the sahara and served with NOTHING. \\n\\nI got the sliders at Harris about six months ago and there were four sliders to an order, and they were served on a fanciful, long plate with a selection of condiments - you know, ketchup, tomato, onion, mustard, etc. Normal things that people put on burgers every day. So, that was really disappointing. But it wasn't over.\\n\\nThe bacon \\\"baskets\\\" arrived. The simple fact that they serve it in a basket seems to imply that there will be a pretty decent amount of bacon in there, right? Nope. There were literally exactly four sad little pieces. The big basket only made 'em look all the sadder. And they'd somehow managed to burn half of each slice black, while the other half was rubbery and undercooked. Yuck. \\n\\nOverall, I would never go back again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a gift certificate.

Good looking salad bar as well.\\nAssociates: Knowledgeable and helpful\\nSelf Checkout/ Self Scanning:  I use both frequently and run into an issue about every other time I use either.  \\nGeneral Products: I must agree with Barrientos M. review, because many times things I'm looking for are expired!

{"label": 1, "text": "If you live in the city of Pittsburgh and don't want to drive to Wal-Mart, Giant Eagle - otherwise known as \\\"the Dirty Bird\\\" or \\\"Gian' Iggle\\\" if your accent's just right, is where you will shop. Period, end of discussion. Generally, I think monopolies are very bad, and this goes double for grocers because they know their customers are held hostage and can thus attempt whatever fuckery they'd like. Over the past decade, most other Giant Eagle locations in Pittsburgh's East End were shuttered, meaning that the Negley/Centre store serves everyone. \\n\\nPerhaps my biggest gripe with \\\"Market District\\\" is that our bills at this Giant Eagle were consistently 15-18% higher than our bills at any other grocery store, in any city I've shopped in - and that's WITH the coupons and Advantage Card \\\"discount\\\" added on. I guess in the end, calling something a Market District Giant Eagle is a clever way of telling customers \\\"We stock all the same crap you'd find at a regular store, but now we can charge you even MORE for pretending it's premium, organic, or has been blessed by Emeril Lagasse.\\\" You also need to know that over-crowding is unavoidable at this store, unless you like to start your errands around 10 PM, and even then, it's helpful to remember that customers exceed checkout lanes. Good thing we lived within walking distance of this location, because parking at this store is only marginally easier than driving a caravan of elephants through Manhattan at rush hour. \\n\\nThis store was never wanting for basic grocery staples when we shopped, but the \\\"Market District\\\" moniker somehow demanded that the aisles be set up to be as maximally non-sensical as possible. Do you want juice? Save your sanity, and don't expect it to be near the other juices...you'll want to look near the pasta, of course! To keep you on your toes, the store managers also randomly change the aisles at this Market District around a couple times a year. This is a common retail trick, intended to create \\\"excitement\\\" among customers, but really, all it does is make getting groceries as enticing as getting kicked in the balls. And who is stocking the produce at this place? Everything we bought would rot between 24-48 hours after we brought it home, and the peppers and tomatoes regularly looked like Mickey Rourke's face after his plastic surgery disasters.\\n\\nMy last visit to this Market District store left me with an exceedingly sour taste in my mouth, thanks to some shady hijinks at the pharmacy. We picked up my husband's script for a Schedule II medication, and soon after, discovered to our mutual horror that the pharmacy had shorted us 12 pills. 1 or 2, maybe 3 - that's an innocent mistake. A 12 pill shortage on a 30-pill prescription means someone chose a career in pharmacy to feed an addiction or run a little hustle on the side, and it means my husband will be going without. We asked the manager, \\\"Dude, what the fuck,\\\" and the response we got was, \\\"We didn't do nuthin'!\\\" Two weeks later, they had the nerve to Robo-Call my husband asking if he was interested in some \\\"valuable grocery coupons.\\\" Nice attempt at a save there Bub, but next time, don't snatch our money and we won't need those \\\"valuable\\\" coupons after all. (Isn't it also fascinating that we've been shorted on scheduled meds at other pharmacies before, but no one pockets our migraine meds, antibiotics, or other items you can't sell to teenagers in an alley?)\\n\\nTwo stars because the check-out staff is nice and the pasta/kosher deli selections rock.

{"label": 1, "text": "After months and months on hiatus I have made a resolution that I think I'll actually be able to keep (unlike the NYE 'resolutions' exercise and less carbs) and that is to get back to the good work of keeping up with yelp and my amateur reviews.  It started to feel like homework, but all fair and decent people need be warned of the good and the bad this and other cities have to offer by impartial peers'.  Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\\\"Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\\\"...\\\"Sure, what is it?\\\".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole."}

Our waiter was attentive--until the entrees were served. Then he disappeared. Not only did he disappear but every other server went deaf. They were not so busy that this was necessary. For the size of the restaurant and the number of servers it should not have taken an additional 20 minutes after we had eaten to have plates cleared.

They usually have 2 vegetarian and 2 non-vegetarian daily options. I love their limeade (its terrifically bright and fresh, made from real limes). Also, if you happen to be really rich (which I'm not) you might fancy buying some of the Peruvian art they sell in the store. Try touching the pelts on your way out, probably the softest fur you've ever felt in your life. Also, they have fun finger dolls, knit to look like naked people.

However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.\\n\\nIt is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\\n\\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.\\n\\nBetter alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Caf\\u00e9 or even Square Caf\\u00e9, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.\\n\\nFrankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.

{"label": 2, "text": "So many great reviews.  Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.\\n\\nFood = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the \\\"guacamole.\\\"  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.\\n\\nAmbiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.  \\n\\nService (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.\\n\\nOverall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.

I had been wanting to come here since I randomly caught it on an episode of \\\"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\\\" and last night was the perfect night for us.  The outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had.  The inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens T.V's on the wall, a U shaped bar on one side, booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room.  My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.\\n\\nThe bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted."}

After everyone arrives, you watch a little video about the history of the place, including paranormal history. After that, your tour starts.\\n\\nYou walk over to the house, and tour the house, from downstairs to upstairs. Then, you walk outside to the outdoor kitchen, and then to a workmen's shed. Then you walk past an old log cabin, and then get led back to the main gift shop. \\n\\nThe tour guide we had a was a very informative old lady. She told us a lot of history, and I learned new things. At one point of the tour, I did get a little lightheaded, and felt a little weird, and it was near an area where the tour guide said that she also has had weird feelings. What's even weirder is that on our back home, my dad was telling me that he got lightheaded in a certain area, and when I asked him where, it was the same place I had gotten the same feeling! It was kinda spooky finding that out, but then kind of cool.\\n\\nThe tour was about ~$10 and I think it was worth it. I got a little spook, and learned a good history lesson. And I visited a historic plantation.\\n\\nIf you're visiting the area, and are looking for something interesting and different to do, I suggest coming here. No matter what time of year. But if you happen to come during October, then you'll just get an added bonus of hearing some ghost stories along the way too."}

We had scheduled a team-building group event at the US National White Water Center and so I searched for hotels around that area. When I saw this hotel featured as an airport hotel I figured it would be in a safe enough location with some close-by eateries and quick highway access, etc...\\n\\nWe booked a total of 13 rooms with them and checked in individually. I had been in contact with one of their hotel managers. I was a little dissatisfied in how poorly I welcomed to the hotel. \\n\\nThe front desk clerk seemed \\\"oh-so enthused\\\" to be working that night, and when I let her know that I had been in contact with the manager and just wanted to make sure everything was in good standing, she went in the back, he was there, and never even came out to greet me.\\n\\nNow I didn't expect any VIP treatment. But usually when you organize a group event at a hotel you are give a very warm welcome. I know this because this wasn't a first for me.\\n\\nI had requested a room with a crib (only two months in advance, with a reminder the day prior), and when I requested one that night, yes the same clerk, took over an hour to get it. At first I wasn't even sure if she was going to because she never did give any indication she was paying attention to me at all.\\n\\nThe cable and internet did not work our first night there. No apologies were issued.\\n\\nThe room had a musty smell to it. I have a family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, and one baby) but they only had 3 towel sets in the room...even the next day after housekeeping came.\\n\\nThe hotel was not in the best of locations, it was secluded and not close to anything, and price-wise you could find better closer to downtown. I am not from Charlotte, NC and had only been there once...and again I figured \\\"airport\\\".\\n\\nThe hotel interior was nice and they did have a complimentary hot breakfast from served until 0930 am (another fact of information I had to PRY out of the front desk clerk). \\n\\nThe staff working the morning shift were much more pleasant and inviting. \\n\\nThe hotel was very quiet at night which we appreciated. The doors did not slam, thank God, as our baby girl is a very light sleeper. The hotel itself is clean and kept nice. It was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express.\\n\\nI rated poor because of the customer service but overall I would give it a three (average). However, I would not book here again not mainly due to my experience but due to the location. There are better hotels averaging the same distance from the USNWC but in better areas.\\n\\nIf anyone from management every reads this, please take a look into \\\"Deborah\\\" the front desk jerk...I mean clerk.\\n\\nStayed July 2011, traveled on business"}

As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. \\nI started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \\\" missing manual or dead battery\\\" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. \\nI was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. \\nI asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. \\nI get \\\"as is\\\" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.\\nNow I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. \\nThank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.\\n\\nPissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad"}

It's good soup.  But spicy?  No.  No it is not.\\n\\nMain course is the Blackened Catfish Sandwich.  This right here is what I'm talking about.  The filet is a monster.  A tasty, flakey monster.  They pair it up with a tarter sauce (did I detect a pepper in there?  Chipotle maybe?) and some kind of other sauce that was like a chunky salsa/sweet-n-sour thing.  Doesn't matter.  I dumped both of them on.  It was tasty as all get out.  I devoured the enormous sandwich. The side dish I chose was the Broccoli Slaw and honestly, it tasted like 'healthy'.  Skip it.  Do the cajun fries instead."}

You see, I'm often wondering if my mom is going to slap me for not saying anything nice and then bitch-slap me for never listening.  Or something.  I really wasn't paying attention.\\n\\nOr maybe it is not that bad.  There are, after all, nice things to say about Matt's.  But there are spotty areas as well.\\n\\nFirst the good...\\n\\nThe decor is marvelous (insert mid-80s Fernando accent via Billy Crystal here).  They have a decent number of seats, the outdoor seating is second-to-none - but you can bring your own lunch and get that, so it's not really specific to Matt's.\\n\\nAnd the not-so-good...\\n\\nThe menu selection is immense.  So much so that you'll want to go when the place isn't crowded so that you have a reasonable chance of looking it over before ordering so as not to get in the way of anyone else.  That generally doesn't happen in most hot dog stands, either on the street or indoors because you have about two choices: All the way or plain, where you add your own condiments.\\n\\nAnd the rest...\\n\\nThough you can find Italian Beef and Chicago-style dogs in the same place, you don't always want to.  Focus on your specialty.  And that's the real problem here.  There is so much going on - visually and on the grill - that they don't seem to do anything really well.\\n\\nThough the staff is nice enough, and food is decent, it's just not that great.  Fries are limp.  House-made chips are nice and thin, but they are so thin that they can't support anything (dressing, chili leavings from dogs, not even the crunch from the fryer).  Dogs are average.\\n\\nI would much rather get a dog from Green's, or maybe Hap's, both of which have that awesome hot dog counter vibe and make me want more.  Matt?  Not so much."}
{"label": 2, "text": "While this place has a good # of tvs, for some reason I just don't enjoy watching games here. The view is decent from almost anywhere in the bar, but I think the lack of a loud fan base really takes away from the atmosphere. No one seems too thrilled that the games are on & not much cheering seems to be done. They also have a large projection screen showing the main game so if you can get a seat in front of this it's pretty good viewing. And flat screens are located throughout showing other games throughout the day.\\n\\nI've never had the food here, I've only been for the nightlife/game watching, so I can't comment on the menu or the food taste. There's a good selection of beer both on tap & in bottles. The prices are pretty on par with any bar/restaurant located on Tryon in Charlotte, so I can't really complain here. They also have a couple pool tables, and a lounge upstairs if you want to get out of the main bar scene.\\n\\nFox & Hound won't blow you away with anything, especially if you're there to watch a game. It always seems to be packed so there must be something that keeps bringing people back again & again. Check it out & you may actually like it better than me if you don't like the loud sports crowd but still want to watch the game."}

I ordered the hazelnut crusted chicken primarily because I noticed before we went that a few reviewers here on yelp recommended it. It was reallllllly good! Also HUGE portions that hubs had to help me eat. the chicken itself was really tender and juicy and that crust and sauce are delicious. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, as you'd expect, and even the vegetables were yummy. We also had the jalapeno spinach dip which was not that great. I mean it was fine, but out of all the spinach dips I've tried in my life, it was not on the top 10. The atmosphere is nice, it's pleasantly decorated and clean, nothing special.

Our service was quick and adequate, although our specific server seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else but work that night.

Our server was friendly and adequate, not magnificent.\\n\\nI decided to give Presto a try since they had a groupon coupon a while back.  So I had some money to spend, and Iwas able to taste quite a few dishes.  We started off with two appetizers: calamari and crab dip.  Calamari was very good; however, the sauce was, well, gross.  It was overly sweet and had an odd flavor.  We just ignored this and ate the calamari, as is.  The crab dip was another disappointment.  We were given plenty of chips, way more than we had dip for, which is never a great sign.  The cheese had a Velveeta consistency which I absolutely despise!  The cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor.  Toward the bottom there were whole chunks of crab...and you guessed it...now without any cheese!  \\n\\nI ordered the lasagna which came with a salad.  I ordered the Caesar salad.  Wow, this was just embarrassing (for them).  It was literally chopped Romaine with bottled dressing (I'd bet all my money - Ken's Steakhouse non-creamy kind).  I had about 4 bites and just put it aside.\\n\\nThe lasagna.  Well, remember that sauce with the calamari?  That's what is in the lasagna!  I actually had to send the dish back.  I was so disturbed by this sauce that I HAD to ask what was in it.  Well, tell me what you think - tomato sauce with cinnamon, and brown sugar.  \\n\\nI traded it in for a sandwich.  I just didn't know what to do.  I got a veggie sandwich with fries.  As a PS - bread was over saturated with oil but veggies tasted good.

You heard me, landed in Charlotte and after checking into my hotel, I decided to B-Line it to Mert's; because there was a need in me to have some good food, and I got delicious food.  \\n\\nFirst let me comment on the service... it was genuinely amazing.  I was promptly seated, and the hospitality was refreshing.  The server helped me patiently figure out what was good, and we settled on Southern Fried Chicken, Collard Greens and Mac & Cheese.  The Cornbread came out first, and it was mildly sweet, and tasty. \\n\\nLet's break down the meal.\\n\\nFried Chicken:  From the moment I took my first bite of the chicken breast, it was perfect cooked, juicy and hot, the meat was lightly battered, and the batter that was on it, was seasoned well.  It was a one of the better pieces of friend chicken I have had, not dry at all.   I would eat this every day, if I lived here, and I didn't have to worry about eating fried foods.  Recommendation, eat it, yum. \\n\\nCollard Greens:  I've had collard greens before, and this was good as most.  Admittedly, never had it with tomato before, but it was still delicious.  I liked the flavor, and the greens were tender, soft but with a nice bite.  The portion of the side was right, and complemented the chicken right.\\n\\nMac and Cheese: Yes Sir, this stuff was creamy, delicious, sauce done with tons of cheese flavor.  It was cooked right, because you don't see any sauce/oil separation.  In fact, all you do is taste the various textures, from the small clumps of cheese, to the noodles which are just cooked past al dente, but not much after.  It's like creamy goodness, yummy heaven, sometimes, I think you can make Mac and Cheese just the entire meal. \\n\\nHere we go, I love good food... but like a good infomercial... THERE'S MORE!\\n\\nWhat in the world is a Sweet Potato Cake?  That's lovely stuff, I had some, and it's like a tasty and the cream cheese frosting was amazing.  I think they spiked it, crazy amazing, not overly sweet, the texture was nice, and it melts in the mouth.\\n\\nHere's the kicker; I ate all the food and this doesn't really happen much, but it was perfect portion.  I'm 6'1, about 225lbs, and I thought all this southern comfort food would leave me heavy; but nope, it was just the right amount, and all for 15 dollars, with a coke.  \\n\\nLike many other Yelpers, KICK ASS food.

We came in and it was really busy. I ordered the fried chicken breast with sides of collard greens and mac and cheese and my friend ordered the Whiting poboy. The collard greens reminds me of Vietnamese mustard and greens and was so good. That is probably the best friend chicken I've ever had. The skin was flavorful and the meat was juicy and tender. Many times friend chicken comes out really dry, but not at Mert's. Of course I completed my Southern meal with some sweet tea."}

It was warm and with some butter....it practically melts in your mouth. \\n\\nFor my meal I had the pork chops, macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. I was impressed with the amount of food you get! Two juicy and well seasoned (yay!) pork chops blackened with delicious seasoning. Very good. For me, the sides were just okay again. I'm not sure what to get that will give me that \\\"amazing\\\" feel but I guess I'll keep trying....\\n\\nI couldn't leave without trying some dessert so I ordered the strawberry cake.

The dude driving the shuttle was very polite and curtious ... I'm guessing because he didn't have to stay or work in the Hotel itself.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.\\n\\nThe gym facilities are atrocious. 2 Treadmills, a recumbant bike, and an Elliptical machine with maybe 4 medicine balls littered around a room that measures 6 ft x 20ft, if that. A grotesque pool with a grimey bottom that on more than one occasion I considered drowning myself in to free myself from my mortal shackles and break free from this prison of a hotel.\\n\\nConcierge wasn't helpful at all -- when I arrived at the front desk and asked if I could score a bottle of water to use the gym, because I didn't feel like paying the $4.00 fee for drinking the Fiji water they had in my room, the guy at the front desk stuck up his nose and snootily informed me \\\"You can purchase water from the gift shop.\\\" Sorry buddy, at over $150 bucks per night, you can *give* me a water for the cost of... free. Also, what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift?\\n\\nThe in House internet is the slowest you will find. I'm a computer / IT guy myself and it is flagrantly apparent that this place throttles their bandwidth usage. Online Games of any type slow to a crawl, and streaming video sites such as Hulu or YouTube take forever and a day to load. This is the year 2010 -- we should have hover cars by now, but apparently its too much to ask for a sad excuse for a Hilton to manage their Internet Connection enough to let me watch the Keyboard Cat before dying of boredom.\\n\\nThe location is also horrible. Right next to the Nascar Hall of Fame ... and thats about it. Everywhere you'd want to go is located 1/2 mile or so into the city, so you have to take the shuttle to get anywhere. Without the shuttle, this place would be unstayable.\\n\\nAlright / Mediocre Rooms + Satisfactory Shuttle Service + Snooty Concierge + Horrible Gym Facilities + Atrocious Location = Don't waste your time.

I was surprised that the dress code was so casual for such a nice place; my husband and I dressed up (hey, it's not every day that we eat so fancy!) but we saw folks there in shorts and flip flops, too.\\n\\nWe started with the delicious bread, and calamari. The calamari was spicy, and it would have been better with some sort of dipping sauce, but I guess that isn't classy enough for the Capital Grille! I just squeezed lemon juice all over my plate and it was delicious.\\n\\nI ordered the citrus-glazed salmon for my entree, with a spinach salad and warm bacon dressing on the side. The salmon was a very generous portion that was very well done. I'm very picky when it comes to salmon and I found this to be fresh and delicious. The salmon also came resting on a generous bed of asparagus, onions, etc. which was an unexpected surprise as we'd been told that all sides were a la carte. I definitely could have skipped the spinach salad, just because I already had so much food and we were staying in a hotel without a mini fridge. But the salad itself was delicious- more of a dinner portion than a side, actually.\\n\\nMy husband ordered the steak and lobster. At $49 it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, yet is was a LOT smaller than my salmon (which was $33). He was disappointed at the size for that price, actually. But it still managed to be large enough that he couldn't finish it, with the bread and calamari he'd already eaten. The steak and lobster were both delicious, though.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable.

How cool is that?!\\n\\nBut this place is a hellhole for people who really like to dance without getting blind wasted.  There is no designated dance area and the place is fairly large, so you end up with a bunch of people milling about, beers in hand.   I have never seen so many people so slovenly drunk bumping into you or spilling their drink on you.  It's like dancing in a barn with all the animals running loose.   It's probably the gothiest place in town and I really wanted to like it place but all three times I've been I spent more effort trying to control my violent tendencies than having fun dancing.\\n\\nAnd the DJ is overkill.  Three screens show movies and videos which is fine.  But it gets really annoying with the DJ calling out the names of every band and song. Perhaps he thinks you were too drunk to remember or too young to have lived it.  We all know these songs by heart, it's totally cliche and they're not teaching us anything new.  The DJ just likes being the center of attention which provides an abhorrent atmosphere.  \\n\\nThey also completely mash songs together, sometimes running over the best parts of the end or even the middle of a song with the beginning of another.  They do not watch the dance floor which is DJ Lesson #1.  If a good thing is already happening on the dance floor, don't mess it up.  I heard three crashes in a row on the dance floor one night and the entire crowd just stops moving.  It makes it a memorable night.  But not in a good way.\\n\\nPS: Whatever happened to the \\\"no bottles or glassware on the dance floor\\\" rule?  I guess they only enforce that at \\\"classy\\\" establishments."}
{"label": 3, "text": "I vacillated between 3 and 4 stars for the Breakfast Club...but, ultimately, is you're having a) bachelorette bar crawl, b) an '80s night of any kind or c) it's super late and you're jonesin' for some Michael Jackson tunes...Breakfast Club nicely fills the void. \\n\\nI don't go clubbing. I really don't. Because my alcohol tolerance is (now) that of a 65 year old, sometimes it's just better that I have a drink or two and get home by midnight. Therefore, I'm not going to compare Breakfast Club to any other club in CLT. Plus, it would be unfair. \\n\\nThe pros: Fantastic '80s music and videos. Plenty of space to dance. The venue is incredibly unique, kitsch-ly decorated and BIG. A really great place to bring a bunch of guys or girls and celebrate a fun decade. \\n\\nThe cons: Some other guests can be overly drunk and, therefore, douchy. Drinks are expensive for what they are. I recall paying $8 for the tiniest of tiny rail vodka soda. The cover can be high. \\n\\nIf you're bopping around the Charlotte club scene, bar scene or you're just looking to try something different, Breakfast Club is a must visit...even if just once per year!"}
{"label": 1, "text": "I really want to like this place because it is right across the street from where I work and we really have no other lunch options that are very close by.  However, it is very incosistent.  The past 3 times I have gone for lunch they have been out of something for the chicken cesear salad, but have not told me until I receive my order.  The first time they were out of parmesean cheese, the second time they were out of the usual sliced white meat chicken and replaced it with what appeared to be shredded leg meat and finally today they only had half a small to go cup of dressing.  All three of these items seem to be very important to making a salad that only has 4 ingredients.  If I would have known this upfront I would not order the cesear salad.  I guess I should always ask before I order to ensure that they have all of the ingredients.  In addition, it seems a little pricey for what they offer.  I can pay $9 and get a better salad at many other places uptown, I guess they are able to charge for convienence."}
{"label": 3, "text": "this place is fun because it is on the light rail line.   things here do tend to be expensive, but i will say the sushi is yummy and normally priced.  the tizerts cakes are so delish i would eat them until i died."}
{"label": 2, "text": "Trendy-looking on the inside, which immediately ups the cool factor.  An ex-boyfriend took me here on a date and we enjoyed it.  I liked all the food we had except the foie gras; not necessarily the restaurant's fault, I just didn't like the texture.  I didn't want it, but Brian let me have a bite.  The wine sampler with dessert was a lot of fun.  The service was great....I'm just not sure it was worth the price."}
{"label": 1, "text": "I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. \\n\\nThey are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. \\n\\nIt gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight."}
{"label": 2, "text": "It's a good ole southern home cooking joint on the west side. The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). \\n\\nFood is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful. But knowing so still doesn't stop us from wanting granny's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter.  What is off in quality at Gardenia is made up by the \\\"sweetie/honey\\\" southern hospitality and down home appeal. \\n\\nIt's a solid spot for a low budget meal.  You will be happy if you have the right mindset and expectation."}
{"label": 3, "text": "I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.\\n\\nI went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here)."}
